I believe\u00a0our\u00a0defense is still in a state of instability and is going to be changing on the fly during\u00a0this game and week to week for a few games. \u00a0As I\u2019ve said before I think Narduzzi and Conklin\u2019s\u00a0plan for single\u00a0coverage by the cornerbacks is a problem waiting to show its face, at least in this first game. \n \nHere is what I think after reading, writing and digesting all the Pitt footballs news, notes and opinions since Pat Narduzzi signed on the dotted line: \n \nReed\u2019s Take: \n  The game will close through three quarters with both teams leading at one point.  Conner gets less than 100 yards but scores two TDs.  Passing game will be OK with more use of our TEs and Peterman will impress in his playing time.  We create\u00a0turnovers by aggressive defensive play but give up more passing (at least one big pass play) and rushing yards than we hoped\u00a0we would.  Pitt pulls away in the 4th quarter to win\u2026   \nPitt 27 \u2013 YSU 20 \u00a0 \n \nChip in with your thoughts as to what you think we\u2019ll see and what the outcome will be. \u00a0We\u2019ll take a look at our predictions on Sunday and talk about the outcome of this important game. \n \nNOTE : \u00a0We didn\u2019t get many responses for suggestions on a meeting place for the pre-game Pitt Blather\u00a0meeting.drink\/bull throwing festivities. \u00a0So I\u2019m asking you guys\u00a0to meet\u00a0at the Bettis Grill before the game. \u00a0I\u2019ll be there at around 11:30.\u00a0I\u2019ll try to get there earlier but have a friend\u2019s tailgate in Red 7 to visit also \u2013 he owes me $40 so I have to break his kneecap. \u00a0After that I\u2019ll go over to Bettis\u2019 and then leave around 12:30 or so for the press box. \n \nI can\u2019t wait to see old friends and meet some new Blather followers. \u00a0Again, check the picture out on this post\u2026 I\u2019ll be the guy with his head above almost everyone else\u2019s, a blue polo shirt with \u201cBlather\u201d on it and longer hair and a DW style mustache.","title":"2015\u2019s Opening Game Predictions","media-type":"Blog","source":"Pitt Blather","published":"2015-09-04T10:43:03Z"}

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \n\nAn email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. \n\nSeparately on Friday, a State Department official said a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. \n\nIn the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. \n\nMost of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. \n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said State received \"several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department\" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. \"These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter.\" \n\nAlso on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. \n\nClinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled.","title":"New Hillary Clinton email chain discovered","media-type":"News","source":"MyEastTex","published":"2015-09-26T00:10:34Z"}

Past News Releases RSS    \n\r Chicago, IL (PRWEB) \r September 15, 2015 \r \n\nLenders like The Federal Savings Bank are always keeping tabs on rental markets across the USA.  Strong rental markets usually also contain strong real estate markets. \n \nThe Federal Savings Bank was intrigued by data released in a CNN Money article from August 19th titled \u201c America's most expensive rental markets \u201d. \n \nPerhaps surprisingly, 10 out of the 15 markets presented resided in California.  Due to the abundance of tech companies and high salaries, Cali is the most abundantly expensive state to live in terms of rents. \n \nThe average percentage of income spent on rent in all 10 California cities was above 40% for: Salinas, San Luis Obispo, San Diego, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Jose.  Above 40% is a very high level.  For Los Angeles, where the median income is $61,482, the average percentage of income spent on rent is 48.9%. Just think of how much money could be saved by owning instead of renting! \n \nWashington D.C. while expensive at a $2,104 per month level of rent, showed the lowest percentage of income spent on rent at just 26.8% thanks to high median incomes of the area at $94,204. \n \nThe Federal Savings Bank believes high costing rental markets are places that give an incentive to first-time home buyers the most to purchase a property.  With home prices on the rise and 30-year fixed mortgage rates continuing to trend sub 4%, now is an affordable time to purchase a property. \n \nThe Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting.  Frequently, the cost of a mortgage + property taxes + association fees are less than the monthly cost of rent! \n \nContact the Federal Savings Bank, a veteran owned bank, to learn more about mortgages. \n  \nShare article on social media or email","title":"America's Most Expensive Rental Markets","media-type":"News","source":"PRWeb","published":"2015-09-15T08:00:32Z"}

It is recommended that people get all the calcium they need from their daily diet. \n\nThe NHS Choices website warns that taking  high doses of calcium (over 1,500mg a day) could lead to stomach pain and diarrhoea. \n\nIt says taking supplements containing less than this amount are unlikely to cause any harm. \n\nIn the latest study, experts from New Zealand concluded that efforts to increase calcium intake to improve bone health had no overall effect. \n\n\"Our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake  is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence  currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents  fractures,\" they said. \n\nThey said calcium supplements have \" an unfavourable  risk:benefit profile\", meaning they could do more harm than good. \n\n\"Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy  organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend  increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with  calcium supplements or through dietary sources.\" \n\nThe experts studied a range of trials on the issue, including people aged 50 and over getting their calcium from milk or dairy, or taking calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. \n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Professor Karl Michaelsson from Uppsala University in Sweden, said  most over-50s will not benefit from increasing their intake of calcium, particularly through supplements, as some recommendations suggest. \n\n\"The weight of evidence against such mass medication of older people is now compelling, and it is surely time to reconsider these controversial recommendations,\" he said. \n\nProfessor Juliet Compston, a National Osteoporosis Society trustee, said:  \"There is not much in these studies that is new. We already know that calcium supplements increase bone density, but on their own do not reduce fractures. \n\n\"However, a recent analysis concluded that calcium and vitamin D did reduce hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and older men.\"","title":"Calcium supplements 'have little effect on bone health'","media-type":"News","source":"Jersey Evening Post","published":"2015-09-29T22:30:49Z"}

While Pluto was in Retrograde it helped us connect to ourselves in a deep dark way. It put us through harsh lessons and forced us to deal with issues around what empowers or disempowers us from the inside out. We have been shown and made to deal with issues around our own personal power in some very important areas of our lives, such as with money, our health, jobs and relationships!\n\nHopefully, we have learned down this darker path more about our shadow-self and what we are truly deeply passionate about and obsessed over. This Pluto Retrograde phase forced us to look at our behaviors and patterns, through some hard lesson and learn what we do that hurts us and take our power away!\n\nAsk yourself what you are allowing to steal your joy? What are you doing or not doing to take care of yourself, in one way or another? This is all about what part of our lives have been the most challenging over the last 5 months, and what's situations made us feel like we had no control or power in. We've also probably either experienced what makes us feel powerful and back in control, or at the very least have an idea of what will help us to change. Over these last 5 months we've had to learn how to be honest with who we are and embrace all of who we are, the good, bad and ugly!\n\nNow is the time to prove what we can do, and let go of any habits, behaviors, or fears that have held us back from fully being living our true potential. Whatever you've been through or learned during this Pluto Retrograde phase about your passion, inner strength or souls path...is now ready to be realized out in the world. The deep connection we made with ourselves over these last 5 months has been a learning experience, to help you be more authentic with yourself. Get back out there and work on your long-term goals, that align more so with what you truly want!\n\nPluto will continue to move slowly as it gets back to its normal pace through Oct. 8th. We may have to deal with some uncomfortable feelings while waiting for this energy to pick up speed again.\u00a0\n~Ruby\u00a0","title":"Pluto coming out of Retrograde!","media-type":"Blog","source":"Rubys Readings","published":"2015-09-25T19:29:22Z"}

We have a big heart. However, there is a\nlimit to what we can do,\" President Joachim Gauck, a former\nrights activist in communist East Germany, said in a speech on\nSunday evening. \n \n\"Our ability to take in people is limited, although we don't\nknow yet where those limits are,\" he added. \n \nThe comments from the head of state, who has a largely\nceremonial role but whose words carry moral authority, appeared\nto be striking a more cautious tone than Chancellor Angela\nMerkel who has said Germany can cope with the record influx. \n \nThe government declined to respond directly to Gauck's\ncomments, reflecting political convention, but defended its\nhandling of the situation. \n \n\"The German government and the chancellor are convinced that\nprotection has to be given to those who need it, whether they\nare persecuted for political reasons or fleeing war,\" said\ngovernment spokesman Steffen Seibert. \n \nThe debate came amid signs of growing tension among asylum\nseekers, part of a wave of mass migration into the European\nUnion from the Middle East and parts of Africa. \n \nFourteen people were injured on Sunday when a brawl broke\nout between two rival groups in a refugee center in the western\nGerman town of Calden, police said.

She said something that really struck me. She said, \"We are all a work in progress, my dear.\" So true. \nSo that got me to thinking about September and the progress I want to see when the month comes to a close. In the past, that would have been easy. I would have picked some arbitrary \"lost this amount of weight\" number and set that as my goal. This time I around, I've learned. I need to find success and joy in more than the scale. I need to find it in new habits and my commitment to a way of life. That said, here are my commitments for September: \n\n1)  Stop stressing myself out on weigh-in days! I go to a Tuesday evening meeting after work. For weeks, I've struggled with trying to figure out how much I can eat and drink throughout the day so that it doesn't throw my weigh-in off. Do any of you struggle with this? This month, I'm going to focus on consistent days, not numbers on the scale. No more Tuesday stress. \n\n2) Enjoy the transition to fall by getting outside to exercise! I love fall. The sights, the smells, the activities, the return to comfy sweaters and other comfy clothes. I'm going to take in every moment and try to incorporate at least one outdoor workout into my weekly routine. Last night, my daughter and I walked three miles. It was her first day back to school and I spent the entire 45 minutes talking with her about her day, her friends, her life. It was priceless and I am definitely going to do it again soon! \n\n3) Finding joy in NSVs! I'm a big scale watcher. I weigh myself twice a day and I've always used that number as my \"go to\" measure of success. This month, I'm going to focus on other things. Did I track all week (and I mean EVERY bite)? Do these pants fit better? Can I walk further\/stay on the elliptical longer without feeling so tired? The scale will drop if I keep working hard. It won't be on my timeline maybe, but that's okay as long as I'm seeing progress. \n\nSo, here's to September and making it a great time to shape up and slim down!","title":"September Shape Up!","media-type":"News","source":"Weight Watchers","published":"2015-09-01T18:03:58Z"}

He said Hong Kong could not copy directly from the West. \n \nThe then undemocratic system in Hong Kong was based on the British system, and had been in practice for a century and a half. Deng said it would not be appropriate to introduce to such a system the separation of powers or a British or American parliamentary system, just so it could be seen as a democracy. \n \nAfter Deng's comments, the drafting committee ceased using the term \"separation of powers\". \n \nIt thus came as no surprise that in Zhang Xiaoming's recent speech on \" A Correct Understanding of the Characteristics of the Political System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \", the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong ruled out the existence of separation of powers in Hong Kong and said that separation of powers can be built only on the basis of a political entity in possession of complete state sovereign power. \n \nWhile Zhang may be correct from a strictly legal point of view, in reality, the political system in Hong Kong has evolved since the colonial era to put in place by convention - in practice and in spirit - the principle of separation of powers. The three branches of government each have their own role and function, creating checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, while upholding judicial independence. Whatever term one may use to describe it, it is separation of powers in a real sense. \n \nZhang described the chief executive as having a \"dual head\" status, that is, he is head of the Hong Kong government and at the same time head of the SAR. Zhang also said that the chief executive has \"dual accountability\", that is, he or she is accountable to the central government and also to the Hong Kong government. \n \nBoth these \"dual\" characteristics, according to Zhang, mean that the chief executive has a special legal status that transcends the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. \n \n\n READ MORE:\u00a0Leung Chun-ying questions Hong Kong's 'separation of powers' model after controversial remarks by Beijing official  \nIn an article published in October 2013, Hao Tiechuan, director of publicity, cultural and public affairs of the central government's liaison office here, recounted that in July 1987, while drafting of the Basic Law was in progress, the British sent to the Chinese a summary on the transition issues relating to the executive and the legislature. Hao said the British team agreed that the Hong Kong government should be led by a strong executive, but there should be appropriate checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, and the two sides should maintain a cooperative relationship. \n \nHao also said that the British stated that the power to accept or reject laws passed by the Legislative Council and the power to dissolve Legco is important to the status of the chief executive under the constitution. \n \nDuring the colonial era, the governor, as the representative of the British monarch, held the power to approve or reject laws passed by legislature and the power to dissolve it, and thus had a status that truly transcended the executive and the legislature. By comparison, the chief executive has a much less \"transcendent\" status than the colonial governor. \n \nWhether the chief executive 'transcends'\u00a0all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor \n \nFirst, by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, the governor was the representative of the British monarch, accountable only to the king or queen. Under Article 43 of the Basic Law, the chief executive is accountable to both the central government and the SAR government. \n \nSecond, the governor was free to reject laws passed by Legco and was free to dissolve the legislature. Under Article 50 of the Basic Law, the chief executive has only very limited power in this regard. \n \nThird, there was no mechanism for the impeachment of the governor. Yet, the SAR legislature can initiate proceedings to impeach the chief executive in accordance with Article 73 of the Basic Law. \n \nFourth, during the colonial era, the council did not have the power to force the governor to resign. Under Article 52 of Basic Law, the chief executive must resign under certain specified circumstances. \n \n\n READ MORE:\u00a0Hong Kong's judicial independence is here to stay - as long as 'one country' and 'two systems' are both fully recognised  \nThe chief executive's inherited status and power of the governor have been curtailed by the Basic Law. Whether the chief executive \"transcends\" all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor, as suggested by Civic Party legislator Alan Leong Kah-kit. \n \nNot only does he not have an imperial sword, as former education chief Michael Suen Ming-yeung stated, but, rather, recent events - including the High Court ruling against the Chief Executive in Council's decision to refuse to issue a TV licence - clearly show that the SAR's vibrant and independent judiciary is the sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the \"transcendent\" chief executive. \n \nJohn Chan is a practising solicitor and a founding member of the Democratic Party","title":"Hong Kong chief executive is not above the executive, judicial and legislative powers - according to the Basic Law","media-type":"News","source":"South China Morning Post","published":"2015-09-25T09:53:56Z"}

Thanks to Corrine and Pat for being mindful of the welfare of others. I'm re-posting the text below from Labor Day 2007 as it continues to be relevant in the context of the status of immigrants in this country and around the globe. Too many Americans oppose immigration as they fear competition for jobs from immigrants seeking safe haven within US borders. The success of an initiative by my employer a few years ago should lay those fears to rest. Nevertheless, we continue to harass Hispanic immigrants in the US, while around the globe, Syrian refugees are too often turned away. Picture this: I\u2019m a young WAF assigned to clerical duties in an office on Scott Air Force Base, near East St. Louis, Ill. On this particular morning I overhear an Air Force major and a colonel, both Caucasian, discuss the qualifications of a civil service employee under consideration for promotion; the colonel apparently likes her resume. Then he asks, \u201cIs she Caucasian?\u201d\n\u201cNegative,\u201d the major replies.\nHere's the deal: I\u2019m a Caucasian who grew up in lily-white, rural northwestern Ohio, and this was the first time I\u2019d seen up close the ugliness of racial discrimination. Stunned, I sat there at my typewriter, trying to focus on my work.\n(In the weeks that follow, I notice the employee in question is not promoted.)\nOn the upside, my stint in the military provided my first opportunity to make friends with members of other races and ethnic backgrounds.\nI\u2019ve not forgotten Hispanic Maria Venegas; African-Americans Katie Harmon, Annie Terry, and Adeline Lincoln; Parisian French Caucasian Monique Horlaville; and New Orleans French Caucasian Priscilla Bertrand.\nYears passed before I encountered a comparable diversity in civilian life \u2015 diversity fostered intentionally in the regional office of a large corporation located in a thriving upscale suburb.\nAdmittedly, the company\u2019s motives were more practical than altruistic. At a department meeting, Tony, our African-American assistant manager, asked if any of us knew what was behind the diversity initiative. He rolled his eyes when I suggested that our company supported diversity because it was the right thing to do.\nTony then explained the business case for diversity: \u201cIf we want to sell our products to the Hmong community, African-Americans, Hispanics, Gays, women, or other minority group, we\u2019d best include their members in our workforce.\u201d\nAltruistic or not, it\u2019s amazing how quickly people can adapt to an inclusive environment when their livelihoods are at stake and before long, the 2000 plus employees in that huge office building formed a genuine community featuring many of the amenities and rituals of a small town.\nSad to say, our community \u2015 by then a model of diversity \u2015 became a casualty of corporate downsizing when, thanks to technology, our work was moved elsewhere. But for quite a few years each of us had good cause for celebrating Labor Day.\nPerhaps the time will come when a majority of Americans will have matured sufficiently to create similar communities, whatever their context, purely because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u00a0 \u00a0 Posted by VIRGINIA BERGMAN at 6:44 AM No comments: Links to this post Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest \u00a0 Labels: African-American, Air Force, civil rights, community, corporate downsizing, diversity, equal opportunity, Gays, Hispanic, Hmong, inclusive, Labor Day, military, minority groups \u00a0","title":"A Labor Day Salute to Diversity","media-type":"Blog","source":"Katalusis","published":"2015-09-07T15:14:18Z"}

Jackie however refused - she didn't even like going to doctors. Like my brother and I she was needle-phobic.\" \n\nDame Joan, who said she and Jackie were \" thick as thieves\", also revealed the moment Jackie rang her to say she had stage four breast cancer. \n\nShe only found out about her sister's illness in the fortnight before her death. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nShe said Jackie told her that she did not want to upset her, adding that she said: \" I know all the problems you've been having in the past few years - I didn't want to burden you with mine.\" \n\nDame Joan wrote: \"My voice was so choked with tears I could hardly speak.\" \n\nThe pair, who had been rumoured at times to have a difficult relationship, were pictured together in London just a few days before the death when Jackie was on a promotional tour for her new novel The Santangelos. \n\nIn her tribute, Dame Joan wrote: \"Jackie really enjoyed her life so much and lived it to the hilt, and when we were together, even if we hadn't seen each other for a few months, we were thick as thieves.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nDame Joan said Jackie \"hated\" her fourth husband Peter Holm, adding: \"She begged me not to marry him but unfortunately I went ahead - one of the worst decisions of my life. Jackie and I didn't see each other so much during that period.\" \n\nShe went on: \"Unfortunately, a couple of years later another relationship I had came between us and, having moved back to Europe, we couldn't be as close as we wanted to be. \n\n\"Sisters will have their estrangements but happily when that relationship ended and I moved back to LA Jackie and I resumed our devotion to each other.\" \n\nShe added: \"I've never had a better girlfriend than Jackie, with whom I shared so much in common and could enjoy talking and gossiping away about everything when we were together, going to our favourite restaurants or to the movies or on long distance phone calls.\" \n\nIn her concluding few lines, Dame Joan said: \"I don't think I will ever recover from the sadness of losing my beautiful baby sister.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nShe added: \"She will live on in the wonderful memories I have of her from our childhood and particularly from the last fifteen years, during which we were closer than ever.

Anyone who has seen him kick a ball knows that, especially those who saw his 2003 World Cup-winning drop goal in extra time in the final between Australia and England. Jonny Wilkinson has a sharp eye. Anyone who has seen him kick a ball knows that, especially those who saw his 2003 World Cup-winning drop goal in extra time in the final between Australia and England. Wilkinson doesn't raise the subject of that kick in an interview with Fairfax Media, but when asked he still fondly recalls the moment that is etched in rugby folklore.\n\n\"As soon as I dropped it I knew I wasn't going to smash it out the back of the stadium, but I knew it was going to go straight. It was exactly what I was asking for,\" he says with the softest of laughs.\n\nFast forward to today. Even in retirement, Wilkinson, 36, still has that sharp eye. Okay \u2026 he no longer needs to use it for sizing up kicks, or reading a game from his old playmaking position at No.10.\n\nHowever, Wilkinson, who retired from Test rugby in December 2012 - with 97 Test caps for England and the British and Irish Lions - and all professional rugby in May last year, has a sharp eye for talent.\n\nWhen asked about two World Cup players of contrasting size, experience and - arguably \u2013 rugby ability, who could be much spoken of by the time the World Cup ends on November 1, Wilkinson says ...\n\nWallabies veteran Matt Giteau, 32, 85kg, 178cm and the sole survivor in this Wallabies squad of that losing 2003 side with 96 Tests caps since his 2002 Test debut. and England rookie Sam Burgess, 26, 116kg, 196cm, with two Test caps and a World Cup debutant a little less than one year since leaving the 2014 NRL premiership winning Rabbitohs.\n\nPending selections, both centres could square off in their crucial Pool A game at Twickenham on October 4 (6am AEST); or even in the final if both teams qualify.\n\nWilkinson's esteem for Giteau was clear in May last year when he said: \"I don't quite know how a team ever let him go in Australia\" after Giteau missed World Cup selection in 2011 and joined Toulon.\n\nWilkinson believes the Wallabies' fate will largely hinge on Giteau, who returned to the team after the Australian Rugby Union changed its selection policy on overseas-based players. The previously closed door is now open to those with 60 Tests and seven non-consecutive years in an Australian Super Rugby team.\n\nAsked if Giteau's most valuable asset is his ability or experience, Wilkinson says: \"The fact he has been able to accumulate all that experience - all that decision-making ability, all that composure, all that wealth of knowledge and rugby wisdom - is huge.\n\n\"But what's amazing is that he is still plays with a kind of youthful exuberance that allows him to still be a game breaker at any point.\n\n\"That combination makes him dangerous. He is still one of the guys who can make the 50 or 60-yard break.\n\n\"He is still the guy that is creating things. But he is still the guy sitting back saying, 'Now is the time to do this', and directing the team. He could be the one who could turn a game from losing to winning in an instant.\"\n\nWilkinson believes players like Giteau are crucial to any World Cup team.\n\n\"The game is largely at the feet of these kind of players,\" Wilkinson says.\n\n\"It is amazing how dominant and the effect the guy has had on the Top 14.\n\n\"And the Top 14 in France is not a competition - in the way it is played - that should allow itself to be defined by someone playing in the centre role. But he has done it.\n\n\"When you leave space or offer options and you give him a platform to play with, give him some decent ball when he wants it, it is like a red rag to a bull after that.\n\n\"That is exactly what he did and that is exactly what he will do for Australia.\"\n\nDespite voices to the contrary, Wilkinson steadfastly believes Burgess should be in England's World Cup squad just one year into his code switch. \"He is an enormous talent,\" Wilkinson says.\n\nWilkinson says Burgess' \"leadership\" traits are a \"top priority in terms of being a team guy\".\n\nHe also cites as \"inspirational\" qualities, \"his strength in defence and attack\", adding that with \"what he brings to a team with his aura you have a very special player\".\n\nHowever, Wilkinson recognises Burgess is far from the finished product.\n\n\"There are certain elements that are just rugby \u2013 you can take off union or league, it's just rugby,\" Wilkinson says.\n\n\"He has all that, the rugby part. The union part is just positional. There are the subtle nuances and largely to a degree it goes beyond that to managing the game and everyone has to do that nowadays.\"\n\nWilkinson believes picking Burgess or not should come down to balancing his strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\"You have got to weigh up, 'How much are we willing to take, knowing that maybe there may have been another season in there to build [his game] up',\" Wilkinson says.\n\n\"But then you look at the weight of the balance on the other side and say, 'This guy is just too strong. His presence is too formidable in terms of how it affects other guys'.\n\n\"And you say, 'Actually that is going to be the most beneficial thing', in terms of how you might want to use him.\n\n\"And if they are using him off the bench, they can control that game management side because they will be able to send messages on with him.\"\n\nWilkinson hopes Burgess enjoys a long future in English rugby, saying: \"He is a once in a generation kind of player in what he brings with that personal strength.\n\n\"I am a big fan of his and a lot of the other guys coming across [from league].\n\n\"This game of ours is won just like any other game: it takes a lot of time to learn it.\n\n\"That goes for us who've played it all our lives, not just guys who are coming over.\"\n\nJonny Wilkinson is a Land Rover ambassador.

According to new data, Milwaukee's seemingly sudden increase in violence is part of a larger national trend represented in statistics compiled by the New York Times:\rLaw enforcement experts are unsure what exactly is causing the dramatic spike in homicides across many major U.S. cities, though they do believe \"disparate factors are at play in different cities.\" Maddeningly, the New York Times\u00a0reveals that \"some officials\" are claiming that the renewed scrutiny facing the increasingly detrimental problem of\u00a0police brutality has \"made officers less aggressive and emboldened criminals.\" Thankfully, most experts vehemently disagree with this theory.\rThough murder rates in New York and Chicago hit record lows in 2014, both rates have shown a notable increase in the first eight months of 2015. New York is currently experiencing an estimated increase of nine percent, with Chicago doubling that rapidity with a 20 percent increase. Garry McCarthy, the police superintendent in Chicago, believes that the widespread prevalence of guns is largely to blame. \"Across the country, we\u2019ve all found it\u2019s not the individual who never committed a crime before suddenly killing somebody,\u201d says McCarthy.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the repeat offenders.

Rape Band 4 (16 to 20 yrs) \u2013 for multiple offending over considerable periods of time, gang or pack rape.   \nThere was obvious serious violence that left her unconscious. \u00a0It would seem to me the case would be Rape Band 2 or 3, not Rape Band 1. \n \nOfficer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Nick Pritchard, said it was one of the worst cases he had investigated. \n \n\u201cThis was a sexual attack that involved extreme violence.

She found a bulky bundle wrapped in black plastic. \n\nInside was roughly 26 pounds of marijuana \u2014 a package that authorities say was worth $10,000 and likely was dropped there accidentally by a drug smuggler's aircraft. \n\n\"It's all right on top of our dog's house,\" Donnelly said of the Sept. 8 incident, which was first reported by the Nogales International newspaper. \"It just made a perfectly round hole through our carport.\" \n\nLiving near the border, Donnelly said she assumed the object was drugs. She immediately called her husband, Bill, who told her to call 911. \n\nThe couple said officers who responded told them an ultralight aircraft smuggling marijuana from Mexico had probably let part of its load go early by accident before dropping the rest farther north, the newspaper reported. \n\nNogales Police Chief Derek Arnson said it's the first time in his three-year tenure that he's ever seen a load of drugs hit a building. \n\n\"Someone definitely made a mistake, and who knows what the outcome of that mistake might be for them,\" Arnson said. \n\nPolice are trying to determine whether the bundle was transported by an aircraft or a pilotless drone. Such runs usually occur at night. \n\nMaya Donnelly said she thinks it's unlikely someone will come looking for the drugs, which are now in police custody. Arnson agreed but said police have boosted patrols in the Donnellys neighborhood for now. \n \nThe family will have to pay the estimated $500 in repairs, as well as pay for a new home for their German Shepherd, Hulk. But the scenario could have been much worse for the couple and their three teenage daughters. \n\n\"Where it landed was clear on the other side of the house from the bedrooms,\" Maya Donnelly said. \"We were lucky in that sense.\" \n\nFriends and family also have gotten a laugh. Several joked that the couple could have profited from the surprise package. \n\n\"That's what everybody says: 'Why did you call 911?'\" Maya Donnelly said. \"But how can you have a clear conscience, right?

Blue chip miners share prices plummeted as soon as the Australian market opened after a horror night for resources stocks on the London exchange, as analysts warn it is particularly vulnerable to China's slowing growth and prices slump. In early trade, BHP Billiton shares are down 3 per cent to $23.12 and Rio Tinto 2 per cent to $48.24.\n\nThe losses continue the declining trend this year in line with commodity prices. Rio Tinto has lost 14.9 per cent and BHP 22.7 per cent since January, and 5 per cent this month alone.\n\nThe decline could see BHP tumble below the year-low of $22.84 reached in August. A fall below this price would see it reach a new seven-year low.\n\nOvernight, BHP Billiton lost 5.1 per cent and Rio Tinto fell 3.2 per cent in London.\n\nThe falls come amid as global markets face the inevitable slowdown of the Chinese economy and its demand for industrial metals. On Tuesday the Asian Development Bank lowered its growth expectations for China.\n\nRatings agency Moody's described the resources sector as the most exposed to China's slowing growth, a call underscored by Credit Suisse, which cut its Chinese forecasts for demand.\n\n\"Much of this is a catch-up to current conditions, which remain highly uncertain, but until China demand and emerging market currencies find a floor, it will remain challenging to put an absolute floor on commodity prices,\" Credit Suisse research analyst Liam Fitzpatrick told The Financial Times.\n\nIn June, RBC Capital revised its ratings for BHP Billiton to underperform but maintained Rio Tinto at \"neutral\" and South32 at \"outperform\". South32 dropped 1.2 per cent on the London exchange over night.\n\nAt the time, EIM Capital's John Robertson warned BHP's had long been overvalued and that he expected it to continue to fall.\n\n\"BHP's value proposition has always been overestimated. It was in almost every fund, individual and institutional, and this demand saved it from the reckoning when the sector repriced, but now its day has come,\" Mr Robertson said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company announced an upcoming vote that could see Australian shareholders sacrifice some of the company's franking credits to ensure it can meet its dividend requirements to UK shareholders. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto shares plunge on China worries","media-type":"News","source":"Narromine News","published":"2015-09-23T00:43:10Z"}

Anything can happen (in boxing). I am not really worried about losing. You can make a lot of money but you still won't be able to talk, walk and have a sharp mind. \n\n\"Of course, it's always about self-preservation. I come first but I appreciate the fans. I do. The only thing I can do is believe in myself. I'm going to be TBE (The Best Ever) until the day I die.\" \n\nMany pundits have doubted Mayweather's claim that he will end his career after the Sept. 12 bout, pointing to the American's U-turn when he came back from a 21-month retirement to fight Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez in September 2009. \n\n\"Like I have said and Floyd has said a number of times, this will be his last fight,\" Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, said on Wednesday's conference call. \n\n\"Why can't a man go out when he has had an illustrious career, accomplished everything that he needed to accomplish and be done? And he has done it his way. \n\n\"Over the last week, I have received three major movie offers. We fully expect Floyd to be heavily, heavily involved in the entertainment industry because this is what he does right now ... that is going to occupy a lot of his time.\" \n\nMayweather, whose 48-0 record includes 26 knockouts, is renowned for his brilliant defence in the ring though he has often been criticized for selecting easy opponents while building his impressive resume. \n\nAsked what he regarded as the greatest achievement of his career, he replied: \"Every fight played a major key ... and number 49 is going to be important also. But my career's not over yet.\" \n\nBerto, a twice former welterweight world champion, will step into the ring as a heavy underdog after losing three of his last six fights but Mayweather is wary of underestimating his opponent. \n\n\"When you've got a guy that's put in a situation with nothing to lose, it makes him work that much harder,\" said Mayweather. \"He has a chance to be one of the top guys in the sport when I am through. You never overlook anyone.\" \n\r\n           \t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \r \r \r\n\r  More from this Section","title":"Floyd Mayweather ready to hang up gloves as 'the best ever'","media-type":"News","source":"IBN Khabar","published":"2015-09-03T05:12:57Z"}

{"id":"fd1ef652-6ed4-4412-9dd2-0e363d45918d","content":"OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \n\nA.M. Best has affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of B+ (Good) and the issuer credit ratings (ICR) of \"bbb-\" of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate, MVP Health Service Corp. Additionally, A.M. Best has upgraded the FSR to B+ (Good) from B (Fair) and the ICR of \"bbb-\" from \"bb\" of MVP Health Insurance Company. Concurrently, A.M. Best has withdrawn the FSR of B (Fair) and the ICR of \"bb\" of MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. (Bedford, NH). The outlook for all ratings remains stable, except for the outlook on MVP Health Services Corp\u2019s ratings, which was revised to stable from negative. Collectively, all companies are subsidiaries of their direct parent, MVP Health Care, Inc., and are domiciled in Schenectady, NY, unless otherwise specified. \n\nThe upgrading of the ratings of MVP Health Insurance Company reflects its revised strategic role within the group, with greater emphasis on commercial large group business in Vermont. Moreover, significant improvement in operating results has been recorded through mid-2015 and is projected to continue into 2016. \n\nThe outlook revision to stable for MVP Health Service Corp reflects its change in strategic direction, resulting in favorable growth in premium and recent improvement in operating results that is projected to continue into 2016. A.M. Best will continue its discussions with the management team about its revised strategy for this entity, while assessing the capitalization, premium leverage and future direction within the group. A.M. Best anticipates that the parent organization will continue to implicitly and explicitly support the entity to fund its future growth initiatives. \n\nThe rating affirmations of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate reflect the companies\u2019 strong brand recognition in New York and well-established network with geographic outreach activities throughout the state, which enhances each entity\u2019s stand-alone assessment as well as the group\u2019s ongoing consolidation of operations and overall sound capitalization. The group gained a larger increase in individual membership due to some carriers not originally being as active in the exchange marketplace. A.M. Best notes that while the group has reported consistent net income over the past three years, it has recorded underwriting losses over the past two years. Management has implemented strategic initiatives to return the group to profitable trends, and through mid-2015, the consolidated operating results have been very favorable. Due to these initiatives, A.M. Best expects the organization to return to its historical level of profitability and maintain a steady growth across its various business lines. The sound but declining level of risk-adjusted capital levels is primarily the result of previous cumulative retained earnings. \n\nA.M. Best believes that the organization has been pressured by the competitive nature of the commercial market, which is driving significant margin compression on existing and new business. Additionally, the continued shift toward government-sponsored lines of business has been challenging. Moreover, the organization faces continued challenges in the operating performance of its Medicare Advantage business line, which is government-funded and heavily impacted by reimbursement cuts. \n\nOf note is the considerable contribution of the Medicaid product line to the organization\u2019s consolidated operating performance, driven by strong results produced through its acquisition of the Hudson Health Plan (HHP). In August 2013, MVP Health Plan, Inc. acquired HHP, a Tarrytown, NY-based Medicaid managed care organization. As this entity continues to be integrated into MVP Health Plan, Inc., A.M. Best will continue to assess the ultimate impact of the HHP acquisition on the organization and its overall operations, strategic plans, earnings and capitalization. \n\nThe withdrawal of the ratings on MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. reflects management\u2019s decision to exit the New Hampshire market and place its relatively small remaining policies into run-off. The run-off and completion of the withdrawal from New Hampshire is expected to be completed by early 2016. \n\nA.M. Best believes that positive rating movement is unlikely in the near to medium term. Key rating drivers that could lead to a negative rating action include further deterioration in operating performance in any of its core lines of business, a substantial decline in the consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization or any reimbursement issues surrounding its government-sponsored products. \n\nThis press release relates to rating(s) that have been published on A.M. Best's website.

(Nasdaq:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, reported yesterday financial results for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, and provides corporate and financial highlights for fiscal year 2015.\n\n\"During fiscal 2015 we executed our strategy to shorten the time to commercialization for PLX-PAD, our lead product, and significantly advanced the development of PLX-R18, our second product,\" said Zami Aberman, Pluristem's Chairman and CEO.\n\n\"We achieved a major milestone when our clinical development program for PLX-PAD in critical limb ischemia (CLI) was selected for Europe's Adaptive Pathways pilot project. Only a handful of programs were chosen worldwide. Pending a single successful Phase II trial, PLX-PAD could enter the European market in 2018 with conditional approval to treat a type of CLI. Another important milestone was safety clearance of PLX-PAD cells for use in clinical trials in Japan.\"\n\n\"We also advanced our U.S. program for PLX-R18 in the treatment of incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation. This year we also announced an important new clinical finding from our Phase I\/II trial in muscle injury, suggesting that treatment with PLX-PAD could also significantly strengthen muscle force in the contralateral leg.\n\n\"During fiscal 2015, we strengthened our valued partnerships with United Therapeutics, Cha Bio and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and finished the fiscal year with a robust balance sheet. We look forward to a very productive fiscal 2016 on all fronts,\" Mr. Aberman concluded.\n\nClinical and Corporate Highlights for Fiscal Year 2015 Include:\n\nDuring fiscal 2015, Pluristem raised net cash of $17.2 million from issuance of common stock, and from exercises of outstanding warrants and options. The fundraise marked the accomplishment of a goal to increase US institutional ownership. In addition, the Company was awarded $2.9 million grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of Israel's Ministry of Economy to support R&D programs, as well as a \"Smart Money\" grant from Israel's Ministry of the Economy to support marketing activities in Japan. As of June 30, 2015, Pluristem had $53.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted deposits and marketable securities. The Company expects this will support its activities for the next two years.\n\nAbout Pluristem Therapeutics Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products. The Company has reported robust clinical trial data in multiple indications for its patented PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells. The cells release a cocktail of therapeutic proteins in response to inflammation, ischemia, hematological disorders, and radiation damage. PLX cell products are grown using the Company's proprietary three-dimensional expansion technology. They are off-the-shelf, requiring no tissue matching prior to administration.\n\nPluristem has a strong intellectual property position; Company-owned, GMP-certified manufacturing and research facilities; strategic relationships with major research institutions; and a seasoned management team.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we discuss PLX-PAD's potential to enter the European market in 2018 with conditional approval to treat a type of CLI, when we discuss our preparation for submission of an Investigational New Drug application to FDA for PLX-R18 in the treatment of incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplant, when we discuss PLX-R18's potential to improve the outcome of bone marrow transplantation, and when we discuss our expectation that our current cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted deposits and marketable securities will support its activities for the next two years. These forward-looking statements and their implications are based on the current expectations of the management of Pluristem only, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Smith ran for 126 yards and three touchdowns, leaving a trail of Beavers defenders in his wake and on their backs for much of the second half.De'Veon Smith ran away with the game, putting Michigan up for good in the second quarter with two TDs.\u00a0Rick Osentoski\/USA TODAY Sports\nThe Michigan defense did its part in trying to establish an old-school identity for Harbaugh\u2019s program. Led by Chris Wormley's three tackles for loss, the group overcame a troublesome start to hold the Beavers scoreless for the final 58 minutes of the game.\nOregon State marched 79 yards for a touchdown on the game\u2019s opening drive and raised trepidation levels at the Big House even higher after forcing a fumble two plays later. Michigan settled down and held the Beavers to 138 yards for the rest of the game and only 4 in the second half.\nIn his first road start, true freshman Seth Collins got off on a great foot, completing eight of his first 10 passes and contributing 75 all-purpose yards in the first quarter. His performance tapered off in the second half and he ended 9-of-16 passing for 79 yards and added 28 rushing yards.\nWhat the win means for Michigan: The Harbaugh era in Ann Arbor begins with a reason to celebrate. After a rocky start, the Wolverines controlled most of the game. Winning the games they\u2019re supposed to win is a good start for the reclamation project at the Big House.\nWhat the loss means for Oregon State: The Beavers\u2019 offense has work to do with a pair of rookie quarterbacks leading the way. They\u2019ll get one more week to work out some kinks against San Jose State before launching into the Pac-12 schedule.\nThe game turned when: An illegal formation penalty cost the Beavers 96 yards of field position. Oregon State punter Nick Porebski's perfect coffin corner kick pinned the Wolverines at their own 2-yard line with less than two minutes to play in the first half, but an illegal formation forced a rekick. This time, the snap sailed well over Porebski's head. By the time he tracked it down, Michigan\u2019s defense swarmed him at the Beavers\u2019 2-yard line. Smith punched in a 1-yard score a few plays later, and the Wolverines extended their lead to 17-7 right before the half.\nStat of the game: Oregon State picked up one first down in the second half of the game. A penalty on Michigan captain Joe Bolden gave the Beavers a first down on the first play of the third quarter. After that, Oregon State ran only 15 plays and held the ball for less than eight minutes of game clock. Michigan ran 43 plays in the second half.","title":"Michigans DeVeon Smith steamrollers Oregon State in home opener","media-type":"Blog","source":"ESPN.com - Pac-12 Blog","published":"2015-09-12T20:19:38Z"}

{"id":"d0aecccd-2411-4059-a1ca-f686419dffaf","content":"The man who bludgeoned Irish student Karen Buckley to death with a spanner and attempted to dispose of her body in a vat of chemicals has been jailed for a minimum of 23 years. \n\nAlexander Pacteau, 21, was branded \u201ctruly evil\u201d after admitting the crime at the High Court in Glasgow last month. \n\n\n\nJudge Lady Rae today sentenced him to 23 years for the murder of the 24-year-old, who was on a night out with friends in April when she was murdered by Pacteau. \n\nLady Rae said Pacteau had carried out a \u201cbrutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman\u201d. \n\nShe continued: \"I find it extremely difficult to find words appropriate to describe the dreadful crime to which you pleaded guilty. \n\n\u201cKaren Buckley was a young woman in the prime of life. She was a visitor to Glasgow, studying to expand her knowledge in furtherance of her career in nursing. She was a much loved member of a close and united family. \n\n\"To you she was a stranger who appeared tragically to have accepted a lift in your car. Within a matter of minutes, for some inexplicable reason, you destroyed her young life and devastated a family.\" \n\n\n\nThe judge said Pacteau had gone to \u201cextraordinary lengths\u201d to conceal what he had done and told a \u201ctissue of lies\u201d and a \"concoted story\" to police investigating her disappearance. \n\nIn delivering her sentence she said: \"You now, through your counsel, claim to be remorseful. Remorse was, however, only expressed for the first time when you pleaded guilty. \n\n\"From a perusal of the criminal justice social work report, it is apparent that in the course of your lengthy interviews with the social worker, at no time did you ever demonstrate or express any regret for what you had done. \n\n\"That expression of remorse on 11 August might have carried more weight if communicated earlier. And it is difficult, in my view, to envisage someone who is truly sorry for killing another human being, going to the lengths to which you went to cover up your appalling crime, whilst making up false stories about the deceased.\" \n\nMiss Buckley\u2019s parents John and Marian travelled from Cork to see Pacteau plead guilty on August 11 and were in court again today. \n\nPrevious conviction \n\nThe qualified nurse had only been in Glasgow for a few months before her killing. \n\nShe had recently left her job at an Essex hospital and moved to Scotland to study for a masters degree in occupational health therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University. \n\nMiss Buckley was described as an outgoing woman whose life revolved around her family and friends. \n\nPacteau, who described himself as a \u201cself-employed sales consultant\u201d, has a previous conviction for printing counterfeit money. \n\nIt emerged after his conviction that he stood trial in 2013 at the High Court in Paisley accused of attempting to rape a woman in a Glasgow lane. He was found not guilty of the charge. \n\nIn the early hours of April 12, he met Miss Buckley outside the Sanctuary nightclub and drove her to nearby Kelvin Way, where he grabbed her neck and delivered about a dozen blows with a spanner. \n\nThe killer visited various shops to purchase caustic soda before placing her body in the bath at his flat. \n\nOn trips to High Craigton Farm on the outskirts of the city, he burned a mattress and clothes before buying a barrel, placing Miss Buckley\u2019s body inside and locking it in a storage unit he had rented. \n\nPacteau initially claimed to detectives, who identified him from CCTV footage, that they went back to his flat and she had fallen and injured herself on the bed frame. \n\nHis solicitor John Scullion QC said he could offer no \u201drational explanation\u201d for his actions.","title":"Judge: Karen Buckley's murder was a 'brutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman'","media-type":"News","source":"Irish Examiner","published":"2015-09-08T09:54:05Z"}
{"id":"2b4af54b-ce8c-4de1-9e1f-b78de04e727d","content":"\u201cMountains seem to answer an increasing imaginative need in the West. More and more people are discovering a desire for them, and a powerful solace in them. At bottom, mountains, like all wildernesses, challenge our complacent conviction \u2013 so easy to lapse into \u2013 that the world has been made for humans by humans. Most of us exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed and controlled. One forgets that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Mountains correct this amnesia. By speaking of greater forces than we can possibly invoke, and by confronting us with greater spans of time than we can possibly envisage, mountains refute our excessive trust in the man-made. They pose profound questions about our durability and the importance of our schemes. They induce, I suppose, a modesty in us.\u201d \u00a0\u2015 Robert Macfarlane \n  \nRead More Daily Reports From The John Muir Trail \n  \nWe returned to the John Muir Trail by heading back over Kearsarge Pass after a resupply. We made it just in time to avoid the storm on the way out, and were heading back to the trail with nothing but dry skies in the forecast. From the Kearsarge Pass trailhead, the path leads downhill towards Bubbs Creek and Vidette Meadow. We got a really early start on this day and stumbled upon a buck sleeping just off of the trail. The landscape here is dominated by the beautiful East Vidette Peak. I would love to come back here someday soon and make the scramble up to the summit. \n \nEast Vidette Peak \n \nAfter reaching the end of the downhill hiking, we reached a flat section that meandered through the forest. It quickly began to climb, and we found ourselves looking out onto the beautiful Upper Vidette Meadow. The tree cover diminished as we gained elevation when we reached the 10,000ft elevation sign. I was excited for the next seven miles that would take us to Forester Pass at 13,110ft. \n \nEntering the Meadow \n \nOnto The Water \n \nOur next point of interest was Center Basin Creek. It was a special moment to cross the creek, and look out onto a granite wonderland without the interruption of a forest. For the first time, I could see just how high we would be climbing in order to get to the pass. We had a number of switchbacks to climb, so I began the process I\u2019ve come to love so much, putting one foot in front of the other. My footsteps had become the metronome for the song of my life. My breathing was in perfect harmony. \n \nBeginning to Climb \n \nLooking Back \n \nGreen Life \n \nWe continued climbing up the wall of talus with the pass in sight. I was amazed at how in tune my lungs were with the surrounding air. I knew the oxygen levels were low, but my legs and lungs didn\u2019t seem to notice. I was hiking at a pace usually reserved for low elevation climbs. I truly had my trail legs now. \n \nThe Pass In Sight \n \nAlpine Lake \n \nBefore I knew it, we were standing on the border of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. The views were absolutely spectacular at Forester Pass. We took some time to enjoy the landscape, and struck up a conversation with a few other hikers. \n \nAt The Pass \n \nLooking North \n \nWe began the descent from Forester Pass and it hit me just how big this day was going to be. Our goal was to reach Guitar Lake to set ourselves up for an early morning summit of Mt. Whitney. We had already hiked close to 10 miles with 3600ft of elevation gain, and we still had 16 miles to go if we wanted to reach our planned destination. Motivation came easy, as my heart and mind were intoxicated with the beauty of the Sierra, the peace of the trail, and the adrenaline from crossing a high pass. \n \nLooking South \n \nOn The Trail \n \nThere were a number of beautiful lakes in view as we lost elevation and pressed onward. At the end of the downhill, we crossed a large creek and then began a winding uphill climb on the side of a hill. Towards the end of the uphill climb, the landscape started to resemble what I\u2019ve come to know as Hollywood\u2019s interpretation of a Martian landscape. I knew that meant we had made it to the Bighorn Plateau. It was here that I got my first glimpse of Mt. Whitney from the East. \n \nOn The Plateau \n \nViews of Whitney \n \nAfter the plateau, the trail once again headed downhill, this time to the Wright Creek drainage. There was a lot of shade in this area, and the day was turning out to be a warm one. At this point, we were only a few miles away from hitting 20 on the day, and my feet were starting to let me know. I feel like I can hike uphill for an eternity, but downhills beat my legs and feet up in a way that always leaves me praying for a swift end to all descents. We took a break near the water and gave our legs a chance to rest before making the final ascent of the day towards Guitar Lake. \n \nFinal Downhill \n \nThe final stretch of hiking for this day was a rather pleasant one, as the trail was shaded, and paralleled a creek for quite some time. The trail really started to level out as we reached Timberline Lake, and it was at that point we knew we were very close. Julia and I were both moving pretty slow at this point, but knowing how close we were to the finish kept our spirits high. \n \nTimberline Lake \n \nApproaching Guitar Lake \n \nWhen we finally arrived at Guitar Lake, we were surprised by how many tents were in the area. We had read to expect a crowd, but this was something completely unlike anything we had seen on the trail thus far. Much like Thousand Island Lake, I had to go searching for a great tent site. I\u2019ve learned in my years of hiking, that heading uphill onto rocky surfaces will get you away from most people. The key is finding a place to pitch. It worked like a charm again this time, as I was able to find a perfect spot that had no one around. \u00a0I had packed an extra days worth of food incase were didn\u2019t make it to Guitar Lake in one day. For the first time on the JMT, I had a true feast. It was so nice to gorge on two days worth of food for dinner! \n \nGuitar Lake \n \nThe only downside to camping at Guitar Lake was being hit by the realization that this would be my final night on the John Muir Trail. Much like the night before reaching Santiago when I walked the Camino, the excitement I held in my heart was bittersweet. After reaching Mt. Whitney, the journey would be over. \n  \nRead More Daily Reports From The John Muir Trail \n  \n\u201cNo matter how careful you are, there\u2019s going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn\u2019t experience it all. There\u2019s that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should\u2019ve been paying attention.Well, get used to that feeling. That\u2019s how your whole life will feel some day.\u00a0This is all practice.\u201d \u2015 Chuck Palahniuk \n  \nSee More Photos In The Gallery Below:","title":"Hiking (and Photographing) the John Muir Trail","media-type":"Blog","source":"Freshly Pressed: Editors' Picks","published":"2015-08-25T05:27:22Z"}

Some are unsung heroes. Others are selfless advocates. All are fueled by passion. \n\nThis list has 10 people and organizations. But I could rattle off 10 times that many. Literally. After I took to social media to ask readers for their suggestions for unsung heroes, I received more than 100. \n\nThat alone speaks volumes about the community. \n\n\u2022 Andrea Eliscu , mentor and philanthropist. When Eliscu lost her husband to cancer 15 years ago, she had every reason to retreat from the world. Instead, she embraced it: helping underprivileged kids, women with cancer, aspiring medical students and more. Eliscu's most creative endeavor is probably her dragon-boat project, in which kids from Parramore team up with Orlando cops in rowing competitions, learning to row and work together. That effort alone was profiled recently on NBC's \"Today\" show. But she has also helped cancer survivors and helped fund a scholarship for the inaugural class of UCF med-school students \u2026 in her husband's honor. \n \n\u2022 David Odahowski and the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation. It's hard to overstate the impact this foundation has on our community. We are talking donations of more than $100 million to more than 800 organizations \u2014 bolstering art and culture, promoting education, helping the destitute and more. The CEO, Odahowski, and his foundation do much of their work quietly but with widespread, impressive results. \n\n\u2022 Judy Sarullo of Pet Rescue by Judy. A lot of people have a passion for animals. Few turn that passion into a lifetime pursuit. More than 20 years ago, Judy started her crusade to find homes for unwanted animals in Seminole County. Since then, she has helped place pets all over Central Florida \u2014 a whopping 60,000 of them \u2014 which is why the Sentinel once described Judy as \"patron saint of abandoned, abused and unwanted dogs and cats.\" \n  \n\u2022 Virtually every public defender. They are overworked, outmanned and underpaid. They are scoffed at by some of their rotten clients. They don't get the time they need to work on cases that truly need it, and yet they can be someone's only hope for justice. Their profession is both noble and inglorious. Frontline prosecutors are in similar boats. The balance of justice often rests with people who aren't making enough money to pay off their law-school loans. \n\n\u2022 The Rev. Bill Barnes . Barnes retired this year as senior pastor of St. Luke's United Methodist Church But he leaves behind a legacy that has both changed \u2014 and saved \u2014 lives. Barnes believed that no one should suffer because of a lack of health care. That belief led him to found Shepherd's Hope Ministries, which now provides 21,000 free patient visits each year in clinics throughout Orange and Seminole counties. The reins here have recently been taken over by CEO Marni Stahlman , who will carry on the legacy \u2014 which includes an impressive 1,800 volunteers. \n \n\u2022 Michelle Mangum , director of Seminole Work Opportunity Program for special-needs adults. Michelle's offices are anything but glamorous. They're housed in an old warehouse with a crumbling second floor in a remote part of Seminole County. But there, she presides over a haven and refuge. At SWOP, developmentally disabled adults get a chance to have a job and earn dignity \u2014 at the only facility of its kind in Central Florida. Mangum could make more money elsewhere, but it's hard to imagine she could make more of a difference. \n\n\u2022 Joy Wallace Dickinson . Yes, the Sentinel's Joy Wallace Dickinson. Loudmouth columnists such as I may generate more mail. But week in and week out, Joy provides a service like no one else in Central Florida: sharing the stories of Central Florida's history in her weekend \"Florida Flashback\" column. History is important in any community. But history- tellers are particularly important in a transient community such as ours. Joy continues to fill that role even after retiring from her full-time days here \u2026 and we should all be grateful for that. \n\n\u2022 Bob Kodzis , professional inspirer. I first profiled Bob, a leadership and team-building consultant, a few years back when he began his new life-work model of donating half of all his services to local charities. (The title of the piece: \"He works one volunteer job for every paying one \u2014 and is richer for it.\") Well, it's been three years. And Bob's \"buy one, give one\" lifestyle is still going strong, benefiting nonprofits throughout the region. \n\n\u2022 Lizette Valarino , fulfiller of college dreams. Many students can get accepted to college if they work hard enough. Not everyone can afford to go, though. That was the problem Valarino wanted to solve when she founded the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Fund. Since she did so in 2000, the fund has provided scholarships to more than 200 students in Central Florida, transforming a whole lot of lives. \n\n\u2022 Donna Dowless , \"Ambassador of Love\" for the city of Orlando. Sure, the title \u2014 bestowed upon her by Mayor Buddy Dyer \u2014 may sound silly \u2026 until you meet Dowless and realize how genuine she is about promoting the upside of the City Beautiful. Dowless is a downtown artist with hip glasses and a cool coif who promotes and embraces all things Orlando and artistic. She's everywhere and all positive, all the time. There's a reason most of her artwork involves hearts. \n\nI have many more winning names to take \u2014 including Dr. Marvin Hardy , singer Mr. Richard , the leadership of Orange County's Legal Aid Society and more. \n\nTo learn more \u2014 or nominate unsung heroes of your own \u2014 visit OrlandoSentinel.com\/takingnames . \n\nsmaxwell@tribpub.com \n Copyright \u00a9 2015, Orlando Sentinel","title":"Winning Wednesday: 10 people who make Central Florida a better place to live","media-type":"News","source":"Orlando Sentinel","published":"2015-09-22T22:42:00Z"}

{"id":"781ec5d1-c8d4-46a5-ac94-5786c65c48fb","content":"Apple Daily: Apple Special Event Primer, Glowing 'Steve Jobs' Review; Apple and A.I. Posted 09\/08\/2015 at 4:07pm | by Leif Johnson 0\nComments If you want to know what to expect at Apple's \"Hey, Siri\" media event tomorrow, we've already got a broad outline prepared for you. Elsewhere, critics are already in love with Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs film, and Apple itself is preparing to hire more people for its efforts in artificial intelligence. The question, though, is whether it's ready to give up some of its commitment to privacy to achieve its goals.What to Expect at Tomorrow's Apple Event\nWe're just a day away from Apple's \"Hey, Siri\" media event, and as has been the case for the last couple of years, so many seemingly legitimate rumors have popped up in the last few weeks that it seems safe to say we already know about most of the things we'll see on stage. (Expect Tim Cook and friends to make yet another joke about how Apple's \"doubling down\" on security.) It's thought to be a product-packed event, with Apple announcing everything from the so-called iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the 12.9-inch \"iPad Pro,\" the fourth-generation Apple TV, to updates for iOS 9 and WatchOS 2 and new wristbands for the Apple Watch. As always, we'll be on hand to relay the news as we hear it if you're unable to watch Apple's live stream.\nAs usual for this time of year, we'll almost certainly see the next-generation iPhones, which (in line with Apple's tradition for \"s\" releases) probably won't look too different from the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. On the inside and in the details, though, they're thought to feature improved Series 7000 aluminum in order to avoid another \"Bendgate,\" Apple's recent pressure-sensitive \"Force Touch\" technology, a faster A9 chip, and 2GB of RAM. In addition, the new phones are thought to come in a new rose gold color option and to sport a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.\nApple is also widely expected to announce the fourth-generation Apple TV at the event, which is thought to come with its own App Store, Siri support, a universal search feature, and HomeKit support. In addition, it will likely come with a motion-sensitive remote control with multi-axis sensors. The remote is also thought to come with both a touchpad and buttons for interactions, a microphone for Siri, and it's believed to come in black instead of the usual silver. Unfortunately, Apple's long-awaited \"cable-cutting\" streaming TV service likely won't make the show as it's believed to be bogged down in negotiations.\nAt last, we'll probably also see the long-rumored 12.9-inch \"iPad Pro\" on stage, which is thought to come with a 2732\u00d72048 pixel display at 226PPI, Force Touch support (along with a compatible stylus), an A9 chip with 2GB of RAM, and stereo speakers. There's also a small chance that it will come with USB-C ports for attaching peripheral devices, but that's one of the more dubious rumors out there. A new, flatter Apple wireless Bluetooth keyboard is also expected to release alongside the device.\nIn addition, we'll probably see Apple announce the iPad mini 4, which is thought to be a smaller version of the iPad Air 2. Along with some (likely minor) updates about iOS 9, Apple is also expected to announce new Apple Watch Sport bands with new colors.\n\u00a0Steve Jobs Film Earns Glowing Early Reviews, Even From Woz\nThe early reviews and opinion pieces for Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs film are in, and it's hard to find a negative word among them. The Aaron Sorkin-penned film premiered at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival over the weekend, where it was presented as a \"work in progress\" owing to the desire for a few more tweaks, but even in that state, it wowed audience members and, yes, even Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak himself.\nOne of the most notable pieces regarding this weekend's viewing comes from Deadline, which notes that writer Aaron Sorkin's work here is \"even more effective\" than it was in the Oscar-winning The Social Network. Deadline calls it \"an action movie driven almost exclusively by words.\" It also notes that Michael Fassbender pulled off his role of Jobs almost to perfection \u2014 \"a spot-on and relentless portrayal of the not-very-likable computer genius.\"\nBut it's one thing to hear this kind of stuff from journalists; it's quite another to hear similar praise from Steve Wozniak, who \"gives full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right.\"\n\"I saw a rough cut and I felt like I was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others (including Rogen\u2019s dead-on portrayal of Wozniak), not actors playing them,\" said Wozniak.\nVariety had similar praise for the film, and it noted that even the cinematography bears the mark of genius:\n\"Besides Guy Hendrix Dyas\u2019 unobtrusively excellent production design, the picture\u2019s major visual coup is the decision to shoot the three acts on three different formats: grainy 16mm film for 1984, lustrous 35mm for 1988, and sleek, high-definition digital for 1998. The distinctions may well be lost on the vast majority of viewers, but it\u2019s just the sort of nicely understated aesthetic flourish that Steve Jobs himself would have surely appreciated.\"\nWe're still over a month away from the film's wide release date of October 9, but already Michael Fassbender's performance is being called Oscar-worthy from several sources, although this weekend's showings also revealed that he faces tough competition in the Best Actor category from Johnny Depp in Black Mass and Eddie Redmayne in The Danish Girl. In his statement to Variety, though, Woz said that \"of all the actors in the film he thinks [Kate] Winslet might be the most likely to garner awards attention.\"\n\u00a0Apple Seeking to Expand Its Artificial Intelligence Team\nApple is apparently eager to improve its expertise in the field of artificial intelligence, and to that end, a new report from Reuters claims that the Cupertino company is trying to hire at least 86 new employees from the field in general and from the field of \"machine learning\" in particular. Apple, so the report says, wants to challenge Google's popular Google Now service that anticipates what its smartphone users want to do, and thus the iPhone maker is courting key researchers from Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other companies.\nNot surprisingly, Siri reportedly stands at the center of Apple's artificial intelligence efforts, and the company hopes the new personnel with improve the service's various functions. The problem, Reuters notes, is that Apple might have to compromise its famed commitment to consumer privacy in order to pull it off.\nConsider the case of Apple's Proactive feature from iOS 9, which performs similar functions to those in Google Now but mainly works with the data that's already on a user's iPhone. Since very little information goes into the cloud, Proactive has little access to online machine-learning research banks that can improve the service or, for that matter, machine learning in general. It's thought, in fact, that Apple's staunch refusal to let the cloud and researchers handle some of its users' information might be scaring away some of the very researchers it wants to attract.\nThere's a chance, the report notes, that Apple might be changing its stance as it attends more industry conferences and strengthens its ties with academia. In the meantime, Apple is working with what it has, and quite diligently at that: according to one unnamed insider source, the company's machine learning has tripled or quadrupled in size over the course of the last few years.\nFollow this article's writer, Leif Johnson, on Twitter.

Eat Bulaga!: When is Enough, Enough?\r\u2014 September 22, 2015\rIt\u2019s amusing how #AlDub and #ItsShowtimePastillas are generating millions and millions of tweets in the micro-blogging site, Twitter. But, it\u2019s also kind of frustrating and disturbing how things are turning out in this so-called noontime wars. I may be fascinated by #AlDub, but I am an avid Showtimer. However, It\u2019s Showtime gets borderline desperate to decide on venturing in yet another copy-cat move, also known as the\u00a0Pastillas serye. In a long list, which I have shared, I showed you the times when It\u2019s Showtime tried to parallel\u00a0Eat Bulaga!\u2018s several segments and contests. Although they clicked, this pestering step done by It\u2019s Showtime is obviously a no-brainer, close-to (if not) pathetic take on their share of TV ratings. Yes, they may have, at some point, overpowered the ratings and the noontime slot against EB, but will that ever give them the right and passage to copy and use the other show\u2019s intellectual efforts as their own and eventually, bad mouth the people questioning this deed of theirs? It\u2019s Showtime Mania: Pastillas for Sale #AlDub took fame and the audiences\u2019 lives by storm\u2013all because of a simple, candid accident. EB automatically gained back the noontime clamor because everybody was suddenly in thirst of Yaya Dub and Alden\u2019s dubsmash stints, their notes exchange, the ups-and-downs of their\u00a0\u2018sa tamang panahon\u2019 love story\u2013all of which seamlessly got to be everyone\u2019s lunch time habit. Imagine a daily Pacquiao-fight-like jam-packed TV viewing at home, public terminals, hospitals, schools, and wherever there\u2019s a TV and everybody could watch. EB\u2019s skyrocketing ratings brought by AlDub was obviously a downtime for It\u2019s Showtime. Thus, the push for them to make use of the other YouTube and online media sensations like the infamous Pastillas Girl. I really have nothing against these people wanting to be famous and make a living through TV exposures, but what I am not really in favor of was how It\u2019s Showtime pimping out this Ms. Pastillas on national television while expecting us to empathize, because she was heartbroken, betrayed, back-stabbed, betrayed by her boyfriend and best friend. Yeah, sure, her story is everybody\u2019s story. Yes, probably that empathy soothed other healing hearts and made way for Toper, Jess, and Evan (her tele-suitors) to travel all the way from wherever they\u2019ve been and profess their love (yes, love\u00a0agad-agad) to Ms. Pastillas. And as I have imagined right from the start, the exes of these\u00a0kiligserye\/Twitterserye would come into place, expose themselves on TV, and add on the story of Ms. Pastillas\u2019 life. But was it really needed, that in order to recover from a losing fight against AlDub mania, It\u2019s Showtime would resort to pimping, selling out Ms. Pastillas and her vulnerability on TV? Was it even politically and morally upright? Yes, they may not be boldly and on-the-spot selling this girl in exchange for sexual delights, but isn\u2019t calling on for male prospects out there to be her Mr. Pastillas a close relation to that? My opinion on this matter is far beyond the mere AlDub-Pastillas wars on who is better or who should be idolized more. I\u2019m only saying that while It\u2019s Showtime may give \u2018chances\u2019 or \u2018opportunities\u2019 to these people, they might be taking the route of a wrong direction. I am with Vice Ganda\u2019s statements on people taking all these stardom against Ms. Pastillas and that she shouldn\u2019t be bullied just for the plain fact that she wanted to share her life story on TV; but, I am typically against Vice Ganda\u2019s pertinacity on claiming that they weren\u2019t doing any wrong, that there weren\u2019t anyone being at a disadvantage in all this, because in reality there is, there are. It\u2019s a shame and insult for women to be auctioned for everyone to see. What would the younger generation say and think about this\u2013that it\u2019s perfectly okay to sell out themselves to people? How about the feelings and right-to-intellectual-property of the people behind every segment or production that was closely duplicated, of the real author of the \u2018pastillas recipe\u2019 who was overseen because fame and limelight was cast upon the girl who used (without permission) the recipe that wasn\u2019t her? Definitely, there is something wrong in this current Pastillas fame. And when there\u2019s someone ill-favored in anything, it should be enough. If you cannot see this, then maybe you should pay a visit to the eye-doctor (or better yet to a mental doctor). \u00a0 **photo credits to the owners** Share this Post:\r\u00ab\u00a0Previous Article\rSecond Rate Copycat: War of the Noontime Shows","title":"It\u2019s Showtime VS.

The company then analyzes the data and creates a system of predictive analytics to help universities figure out who might be at risk of dropping out.\n\nIt also builds applications on top of its data platform that can help students pick majors, and analyzes for university administrators the effectiveness of courses.\n\nCivitas generates revenue by selling software subscriptions. About 850 campuses use its services, including the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, according to its website.\n\nAdarsh Sarma, managing director at Warburg Pincus, in a statement said Civitas was \"a pioneer in the field of using applied data analytics to improve student outcomes.\"\n\nAs state- and federal-funded universities face performance-based funding requirements in which graduation rates are increasingly tied to their budgets, companies like Civitas can be brought in to seek improved results.\n\n\"With this investment, we are going to be able to improve and accelerate both learning and student outcomes for our partner institutions,\" said Thornburgh, Civitas' chief executive.\n\nThe company will use the money for research and development as well as potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nBesides Warburg Pincus, the fundraising round includes previous investors including Emergence Capital Partners, Austin Ventures, Rethink Education, SJF Ventures and Gera Venture Capital.\n\nWarburg has a history of making money from investments in education technology. For example, it sold iParadigms LLC which makes \"Turnitin\" plagiarism software, for $752 million, including debt, to Insight Venture Partners last year.\n\n(Reporting by Liana B.

Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said hundreds of officers were involved in the exhaustive search in Fox Lake following the killing of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz on Tuesday morning. But to no avail. \"That means we're not searching within that perimeter area anymore. The suspects were not within our perimeter,\" Covelli told The Associated Press Wednesday morning. \"We had over 400 police officers out here yesterday. We had over 45 canine units and numerous aircraft,\" he said, adding that officers would now conduct \"saturation patrols\" in a wider area. Authorities from across the state and region joined the\u00a0manhunt\u00a0Tuesday in the village about 60 miles north of Chicago. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks, scanning the terrain with rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the\u00a0manhunt, Covelli said. Residents of the usually sleepy village were urged to stay indoors, and schools were on lockdown. In a statement late Tuesday, Covelli urged the community to reach out with tips and leads. Covelli said Gliniewicz radioed in Tuesday morning to tell dispatchers he was chasing three men on foot. Communication with him was lost soon after. Covelli said backup officers found him injured with a gunshot wound and that he died soon after. An emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. \"We lost a family member,\" Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as \"GI Joe.\" ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.\" The area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. Authorities urged residents to stay home while they searched for the suspects, two of them white and the other black. Commuter train service was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay inside, with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. Several schools were locked down Tuesday, and seven cancelled classes on Wednesday, Covelli said. Gliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. Fox Lake residents expressed sorrow at the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. \"This particular officer is a pillar in my community and (is) definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,\" said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher. Dozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. Thirty-year-old Dan Raminick, who held a sign reading \"Police Lives Matter,\" said officers came by Tuesday evening and thanked the crowd. Caitlyn Kelly, a 22-year-old student, said she felt compelled to come out after other recent police shootings. She held a sign that said \"Blue and Brave.\"","title":"Hunt for 3 suspects in Illinois officer's death continues","media-type":"News","source":"Wicked Local Boxborough","published":"2015-09-01T19:48:55Z"}

In CO we have to have a plan book out on the off chance someone asks to see it, but no one has asked yet.\n\n\nAt my first school in ND I didn\u2019t have to. This year We submit them weekly- every other teacher in the school prints them off and turns them in, I just share a Doc online with all of my plans and materials linked in, but it has to be done by Friday evening. I\u2019m in IL now.\n\n\nNope, no submitting lesson plans.

We submit long range bare bone plans in September but that\u2019s it and no one has ever checked to make sure we are following it.\n\n\n\nWe are not required to submit lesson plans, but we are expected to have them written and available upon request. \u00a0Also, if an administrator comes into our class they want to be able to easily access our written plan.

This included husbands and wives whose spouses died.\u00a0 \n\nThe redress is expected to run into millions of euros for those hit. According to estimates by specialist solicitors Spanish Legal Reclaims after analysing government data, around 30,000 paid tax in the three-year period. \n   \nUnfair tax: Those who faced an IHT bill on their Spanish holiday home during 2011-14 are entitled to compensation. Pictured, Andalucia in southern Spain \n\nThe tax charge was in many cases up to a third of the property's value and it varied between regions. \n\nIt can only be reclaimed by EU citizens after the Spanish government hastily changed its IHT law after the European Court of Justice ruled the legislation - which exempted residents from the charge - was discriminatory. \n\nThe ruling was made last September but it is believed thousands still haven't got the ball rolling with compensation - despite there being a five year limit to put a claim in.\u00a0 \n \nClaims typically take between six to eight months to process once they've been filed and the first glut of compensation is now being paid out. \n\nUnder the law, between 2011 and 2014 Spanish residents were exempt from up to 99 per cent of the tax charge depending on region, while homeowners with a property there had to pay the full amount within six months of inheriting. \n\nWith more Britons owning holiday homes in the sun in Spain than any other nationality, UK citizens were disproportionately affected. \n\nThey include Joan Ridsdale, a 62-year-old payroll administrator from County Durham who was hit with a \u20ac16,000 tax bill when her husband Gordon died. The couple owned a two-bedroom bungalow in the coastal resort of Almeria. \n\nMrs Ridsdale was forced to cash in her life savings to pay the charge and has since sold the property. \n\nThe Spanish authorities are now being forced to repay the inheritance tax paid by non-residents like Mrs Ridsdale. \n\nShe was one of the first to receive compensation from the Government earlier in the year. \n\nThe average repayment is \u20ac25,000, according to Spanish Legal Reclaims, a Barcelona-based law firm which specialises in helping non-residents to reclaim overpaid tax. \n   \nEU ruling: Last year, EU said the Spanish Government had acted unfairly - and people can claim redress \n\nLuis Cuervo, chief executive of Spanish Legal Reclaims, said: 'Losing a loved one is hard enough, but to then receive an unfair tax bill rubs salt in the wound. Yet for years this is what happened to thousands of Britons inheriting holiday homes in Spain. \n\n'Spain's authorities have agreed that non-residents who inherited a Spanish property during the past four-and-a-half years can claim back the tax they paid \u2013 but doing so is a complex and daunting task, as there is no single form to fill in. \n\n'Inheritors can only claim once, so it's essential they seek expert legal advice to ensure they get it right first time. \n\n'Spanish Legal Reclaims is representing 1,000 families from across the EU who find themselves in this position, and since the ECJ's landmark ruling our firm has had a 100 per cent success rate, securing a full refund of tax in every case.' \n\nBritons account for a substantial part of the law firm's business, it says.\u00a0 \n\nThe largest refund it secured for a British client was \u20ac94,000, the smallest \u20ac4,400. \n\nHowever, it takes a large 35 per cent chunk of any compensation on a 'no win, no fee' basis. \n\nMrs Ridsdale used the firm to handle her case \u2013 it secured a full refund of her \u20ac16,000 tax bill, plus \u20ac700 in back interest from the Spanish taxman.\u00a0 \n\nBut, with the fees, she was left with just under \u20ac11,000. \n\nThe firm says it is possible for British holiday homeowners to reclaim the tax themselves, but it is 'fiendishly difficult'. \n\nThey need to work out whether they can claim and then the process involves filling in multiple forms and making your case in court, which is all in Spanish.\u00a0 \n\nHomeowners only get one attempt to lodge a compensation bid. \n\n\u00a0","title":"Up to 30,000 Britons are eligible to claim compensation after Spanish government was forced to change 'unfair' inheritance tax laws on holiday homes","media-type":"News","source":"Mail Online UK","published":"2015-09-08T07:43:44Z"}

Latausha Nedd, who goes by the pseudonym Eye Empress Sekhmet online,\u00a0was arrestedThursday by the FBI and U.S. Marshals over threats she posted on YouTube against whites and police. Nedd was reportedly watching a news report about herself when authorities arrived at her house. A news crew from WSB Channel 2 was at the scene during the arrest. \u201cYou really want people to kill cops?\u201d Nedd was asked as she was escorted to a waiting police cruiser. Neddreplied, \u201cI never said that.\u201d From inside the police cruiser she added, \u201cAll I said was defend yourself against people who want to kill us. That\u2019s all. I never said anything more than that.\u201d The video in which Nedd made the threats appears to have been taken down, but copies are available online. In one segment, Nedd holds a machete in one hand and points a handgun at the camera with the other as\u00a0she says, \u201cRight now we declare, it\u2019s open season on a motherf\u2013king cracker.

She also suggests trying to take over a police station. Nedd lives less than two miles from the Clayton County police headquarters.

A tiny alien creature that washed up on the banks of a river in north western Russia has locals and experts stumped. At first glance it looks like something borne from the abdominal cavity of a Nostromo crew member to wreak space-horror havoc of Sigourney Weaver and the human race.\n\nBut the four-centimetre oddity that was found in the Leningrad region in the town of Sosnovy Bor by a woman named Tamara as she waded in the shallows of the Kovashi River, according to a local television news report.\n\nWith what appears to be an elongated skull, shrunken frame and taloned limb, Tamara's friends thought it was a mutant chicken embryo.\n\nBut Tamara was not convinced the creature she found -- and christened 'Kesha' -- was of such mundane origins.\n\nBiologist Yegor Zadareev at the Krasnoyarsk Institute of Biophysics agreed.\n\n\"It seems that this body is neither fish nor fowl \u2026 this creature has a mysterious skull, no neck and wings,\" he said according to a translation of an interview on Russian TV.\n\nKesha was to be sent to Moscow for further analysis, which is sufficiently vague to conjure images of top secret underground bunker laboratories, reverse-alien probes and mitochondrial sequencing.\n\nKesha had alien conspiracy theorists are dusting off their tin-foil hats.\n\nUFO Sighting Daily, whose other tops stories are \"UFO follows The Donald Trump Helicopter, Tells US Trump will be next President\", and \"City on Mars Inside Alien Skull Found In India\" is eagerly awaiting the results of further tests.\n\nBut Tamara's friends and their mutant chicken egg theory is closer to the money for Sosnovy Bor locals. The key word being 'mutant'.\n\nThe residents of the town, which is in the shadow of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant, are \"naturally suspicious\" of expert authority, reported the Australian duo behind the Mysterious Universe podcast report, tongues-firmly-in-cheeks.\n\nThe plant had a history of disastrous industrial accidents and cover-ups, according to a former Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, Vladimir Kuznetsov.\n\nThree people were killed when a cooling circuit unit ruptured the year the plant opened in 1975. Over last three decades there have been two fires, a radiation spill detected six kilometres from the sight and five other major accidents at the plant.\n\nIf it is a radioactive mutant spawned from a leak at the nuclear power that makes Kesha more Blinky the fish than a flesh-eating alien.\n\nIt's not the first time reports of a bite-sized extra terrestrial corpse has captivated the imagination of Earthlings.\n\nPerhaps Kesha is a distant relative of Ata, the alien-like oddity discovered in a ghost town of the Atacama Desert of Chile in 2003.\n\nThe bizarre 12-centimetre-long skeleton was the star of the UFO documentary Sirius, and paraded as persuasive evidence of alien life.\n\nThat was until an immunologist had the novel idea that a rigorous scientific analysis of the specimen might hold the answers.\n\nAfter mapping more than 500 million reads to a reference human genome and examining x-rays of the humanoid, immunologist and director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Proteomics Centre for Systems Immunology at Stanford Garry Nolan proved Ata was of this world.\n\nAta was human. Possibly a 22-week-old foetus with a severe form of a rare rapid ageing disease, progeria, and died in the womb or after premature birth.\n\nWill the same extensive analysis be carried out to determine the origins of tiny Kesha? Scientists say it could take years.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps Kesha could become the first confirmed proof of alien humanoid life by the time President Trump takes up his second term in the White House. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Bizarre alien corpse discovered in Russia has experts stumped","media-type":"News","source":"Coly Point Observer","published":"2015-09-03T11:52:07Z"}

The measure rose 0.5 percent to 3,052.78 at Wednesday\u2019s close on turnover 55 percent below the 30-day average. Automakers led gains after the government cut a tax on vehicle purchases. China\u2019s financial markets will be shut from Thursday for weeklong National Day holidays. \n \nThe value of shares traded on mainland bourses plunged 87 percent from the June record as the equity boom turned to bust and the government took unprecedented measures to shore up stocks \u2014 including banning major shareholders from selling and curbing index futures trading. Leveraged wagers, which helped fuel gains in the first half of the year, have tumbled by 60 percent since the peak, while the government has wiped out nearly 70 percent of unregulated margin lending.

Cue the arrival of the Giulietta Business Edition.\nThe concept is simple: take the Italian manufacturer\u2019s most fleet-orientated car, fit the new, more powerful, more economical 1.6-litre Euro 6 diesel engine and give it a host of technology designed to make the company car driver\u2019s life a little easier\nAlfa Romeo Giulietta\r1.6 JTDM-2 120 Business 5dr\rProfile:\r9+35\rMileage:\r8k Miles p\/a\r\u00a3151.28\rPer Month, EXC VAT\rBusiness Users Only\rView Details\rBusiness Leasing Deal by: V4B Ltd\rSee our Alfa Romeo Giulietta leasing deals here: Business \/ PersonalBelies the kit list\nAn asking price of just over \u00a319,000 makes the Business Edition about \u00a3600 more expensive than the entry-level car, but the price tag belies the kit list.\nSatellite navigation, 17in alloy wheels, front and rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, voice control and metallic paint all feature as standard.\nYou also get the 1.6-litre MultiJet diesel engine - a powerplant you're normally charged more than \u00a31,000 for.\nRecently upgraded to meet the Euro 6 emissions regulations, the four-cylinder unit has had its power output increased from 103bhp to 118bhp, while carbon dioxide emissions have dropped from 104g\/km to a road tax-avoiding 99g\/km.\nAs a result, the Business Edition drops a company car tax bracket to 17% and now returns 74.3mpg \u2013 up more than 5% on the 70.6mpg afforded by the old engine.\nThe power hike has made sure that the new engine is faster though, with the 0-62mph sprint now dealt with in ten seconds flat (down from the old car\u2019s 11.3 seconds) and the top speed increased by 6mph to 121mph.\nIt doesn\u2019t sound rapid, but a bucketful of torque ensures it feels faster than the figures suggest. There's a slight flat spot low down, but as the revs build the Giulietta surges ahead with urgency and though you'll have to work the six-speed manual transmission, making swift progress is perfectly feasible.Good cruiser\nConsidering this is an Alfa Romeo, however, it isn't especially sporty. Yes, selecting Dynamic on the DNA drive mode selector will sharpen the throttle response and add weight to the steering, but a Ford Focus will provide more smiles per mile.\nThe pedals are all wrong, with poor positioning and a very spongy middle pedal controlling grabby brakes, while the car also suffers from the classic Italian short leg\/long arm driving position and totally numb steering. The gearbox isn't perfect either, but it's still one of the car's better features.\nReading all that might make you think the Giulietta is totally devoid of redeeming features and unworthy of any further consideration, but don't be quite so hasty.\nAlthough the Giulietta is no hot hatch, it is quite a good motorway cruiser and, let's face it, company cars tend to spend more time cruising up and down the M1 than setting lap records at Mallory Park.\nThere's an awful lot of sound proofing under the bonnet and elsewhere in a (successful) bid to keep engine noise out of the cabin, while road and wind noise have been kept to a minimum too.\nIt's also comfortable, with supportive seats and just about enough space both in the boot and in the back to make it practical.Drop-dead gorgeous\nThe customary Alfa idiosyncrasies remain, however, with a seat adjustment that's almost totally inaccessible when the seat belt is fastened, there's absolutely nowhere to put your left foot and some of the plastics feel like they were made from recycled hard hats.\nIt may not drive like an Alfasud, but there's plenty there to remind you that it's from the same stable.\nAnd you can forgive all the problems when you park up at the end of your journey, clamber out, lock the doors (cue irritating beeps) and have a look at what brought you all that way.\nVery little in this class is even vaguely pretty, let alone this pretty. The Focus has something about it, but it's hardly drop-dead gorgeous, the Mazda3 is handsome in a slightly weird, angular kind of way and the VW Golf? Well that's quite classy but it just looks dull when parked alongside the curvy Giulietta.\nFrom every angle it's stunning, with perfect proportions, doe eyes lined by striking LED daytime running lights and the Alfa grille cleaving its way down the front to provide a fitting centrepiece. Then, when you look at it from the rear, there are the exquisite tail lights and the squat stance. Even the key fob is a thing of beauty.The verdict\nWe'd never recommend that you make the Giulietta Business Edition your next company car - it has too many quirks and too many excellent rivals for that - but if you've had your heart set on an Alfa since you were old enough to know what an Alfa was, here's one you might actually be able to justify.

These white papers provide insight to Retail Industry and Transportation Industry thought leaders of the opportunities afforded by indoor location based services and technical solutions being developed by the InLocation Alliance members. These technical solutions utilize the ILA developed technology-agnostic System Architecture which provides interoperability for ILA member developed use cases. \n \nAn earlier InLocation Alliance member survey indicated Retail and Marketing at the top of their efforts to reap benefits in the short\/medium horizon. The results are confirmed by the wealth of announcements or products, trials, and deployment that are unceasingly being published. \n \nThe Indoor Location Based Services in Retail and Marketing White Paper illustrates the opportunities to retailers by describing some exemplary developments and deployments in retail and marketing while highlighting the importance of the ILA -- a catalyst for open innovation. \n \nThe Indoor Location Based Services in Transportation Hubs White Paper shows that the transportation sector is investing in and expecting significant innovation from indoor Location Based Services (LBS). Earlier this year, ILA recognized three leading innovations in LBS applications, two of which were related to the transportation sector. \n \n\"LBS capabilities in transportation hubs offer significant benefits to the operation of the facility, employees, vendors and passengers, creating a classic 'win-win' scenario for all the involved parties,\" said Jouni K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen, Chair of ILA. \"The transportation focused White Paper addresses the growing value of indoor LBS, several specific applications and their value proposition, and the role of the ILA in accelerating the adoption of these capabilities.\" \n \n\"Although many notable examples of deployments in the retail and the transportation industry are already available, with some being reported here, the ILA believes that the time has come for a more extensive activity that will allow a deeper integration of the indoor location technologies in the business processes of both the retail industry and the transportation industry, to the benefit of all involved stakeholders,\" said Fabio Malabocchia, Use Case Working Group Chair for ILA. \n \nIndustry organizations and alliances as well as innovative companies in the Retail industry and in the transportation industry are invited to contact the ILA and cooperate with the alliance to fulfill this intent. \n \nThe latest news and releases from the ILA can be found at http:\/\/www.inlocationalliance.com . \n \nAbout the InLocation Alliance - Formally established August 2012, the InLocation Alliance is an industry collaboration dedicated to promoting indoor positioning solutions that directly benefit the industry and users of indoor location services and solutions on mobile devices.","title":"InLocation Alliance Delivers Two Use Case White Papers for Retail\/Marketing and Transportation","media-type":"News","source":"MarketWired","published":"2015-09-16T12:14:13Z"}

So far, 56 drivers have pleaded guilty to 112 charges, with fines totaling nearly $40,000, according to the City of Ottawa.\n\nUber has been banned or pushed out of some Canadian cities but continues to compete with traditional, regulated cabs in others.\n\nHere's a round up of the response to Uber across the country.\n\nKitchener-Waterloo became the first municipality in Ontario to propose regulating ride sharing services, like Uber. The new bylaw would require all Uber drivers to have a GPS and closed circuit television system, as well as commercial auto insurance policies for a minimum of $2 million to qualify for A City of Toronto staff report up for debate today calls for a new licensing category that would allow ride-hailing services, such as Uber to operate, but taxi industry leaders continue to argue that would mean the \"death of the industry.\"\n\nUnder the new licence, Uber drivers would have to buy a permit, carry insurance, undergo a background check and ensure their vehicle is safe. The report also recommends that base taxi fares be dropped by $1 to $3.25 to make traditional cabs more competitive. \n\nRead more about Uber in Toronto here.\n\nThe City of Edmonton has plans to legalize Uber with new regulations \u2014 but Uber drivers say the move would drive them out of business due to high costs. Uber drivers say the cost of criminal record checks, vehicle inspections, licence applications and commercial insurance would be about $6,800 a year.\n\nPublic hearings were scheduled at Edmonton City Hall today as Uber drivers planned to hold a rally outside.\n\nThe taxi industry in Vancouver successfully fought the relaunch of Uber last year. Uber was forced to stop operating after a brief time in Calgary in 2014. Calgary taxi companies joined other Canadian taxi companies in a campaign called Taxi Truths with the goal of detailing the differences between regulated and illegal cabs.","title":"Ottawa's response to Uber compared to cities across Canada","media-type":"News","source":"CBC","published":"2015-09-16T19:05:15Z"}

{"id":"79d77589-da28-4797-8aa0-e29f7c1bba7f","content":"The castle is one of Japan's most iconic symbols, and one of the most enduring... or, to a certain degree, the least enduring. Built as fortresses to guard important sites while taking the landscape into consideration, many of Japan's castles fell victim to feuds and wars, whether it be from the time of shogun and samurai, or World War II. While there were as many as 5,000 castles in Japan at one point by some estimates, there are now just over 100 in complete or partial form.\n\nAs Japan has lists of three most famous views, gardens, and other locations, there seem to be several different lists out there that rank Japan's top three castles.\n\nAccordingly, I've put together itineraries that take travelers to the four castles in Japan that were ranked at the top of TripAdvisor Japan's annual survey of castles, based on the reviews given on that site. Those castles are, in ranked order:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_651\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"] Kumamoto Castle. Photo by 663highland (CC BY 2.5)[\/caption]\n\n1) Kumamoto Castle\nDespite it being a reconstruction, this is one of the most beloved castle sites in all of Japan, and in the last few years has been consistently ranked as the best among Travelocity reviewers. The original fortifications were laid down almost 450 years ago, but the castle was burned down during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. A few of the other buildings that are part of the castle keep are original, and the area has been designated as an important cultural property.\nAdmission to the castle costs 500 yen and it's open daily from 8:30 AM to 6 PM (until 5 PM during the winter months). Kumamoto Tram's A Line stops right in front of it \u2013 it's a 15 minute trip from JR Kumamoto Station. The flat fare for the tram is 150 yen, payable when you exit. A one day tram pass is 500 yen, and a two day pass is 800 yen.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_652\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"] Matsumoto Castle. Photo by MOILIP (CC BY-SA 3.0)[\/caption]\n\n2) Matsumoto Castle\nThis castle is one of Japan's originals, dating back to 1504. The keep's exterior is all black, giving the castle the nickname \u201ckarasujo\u201d or crow castle. It has survived since then, being saved from demolition during the start of the Meiji period, and has undergone several restorations, most recently in the 1950's. At one point, the castle resembled the leaning tower of Pisa when part of the keep slouched to one side. Matsumoto Castle is in Nagano prefecture, with the Japanese Alps as the backdrop, and is an easy train or bus trip from Tokyo or Nagano.\nAdmission to the castle is 610 yen and it's open daily except during the new year's holiday from 8:30 AM to 5 PM. During the Golden Week and Obon holidays, it's open longer. City buses run from Matsumoto's train station to the castle, including the tourist bus known as the \u201cflying sneaker\u201d (200 yen per trip or 500 yen for a day pass). The North bus will take you to the castle, and note that the day pass includes discounted admission to the castle. One other option is Matsumoto City's free bicycle rentals, available at various spots around town including the train station and castle.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_653\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"] Himeji Castle after restoration. Photo by Niko Kitsakis (CC BY-SA 4.0)[\/caption]\n\n3) Himeji Castle\nInstantly recognizable as the most visited castle complex in Japan, Himeji has fallen in the Travelocity rankings over the last several years as the complex underwent a multi-year restoration project. Just recently completed, Himeji looks as beautiful as it did when it was first built, and is seeking to claw its way up to the top of the rankings. With origins dating back to the 1300's, Himeji's main castles were built in the late 1500's and early 1600's, and have survived everything from rebellions to World War II to devastating earthquakes. It was one of the first in the country to be on UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites. I visited Himeji during my first trip in 2004, a few years before the renovations began.\nAdmission to the castle costs 1,000 yen and it's open daily except December 29 and 30 from 9 AM to 5 PM (in the summer months, until 6 PM). Entry ends one hour before closing.\nFrom Himeji's main train stations (JR and Sanyo Railway) Himeji Castle is a 5 minute bus ride (100 yen) or taxi ride (~700 yen), or a 25 minute walk (which is what yours truly ended up doing).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_654\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"] Matsuyama Castle. Photo by Jyo81 (CC BY 3.0)[\/caption]\n\n4) Matsuyama Castle\nLocated on the island of Shikoku in an area known for its hot springs, Matsuyama Castle is another of Japan's original castles. It was built on a small mountain \u2013 Mount Katsuyama \u2013 and the location affords a great view of the city and the Seto Sea. It has largely survived intact; the castle tower was originally destroyed by lightning and rebuilt in the 1800's, while certain sections were rebuilt as a result of World War II bombing damage.\nDue to its high location, the castle is easily accessed by chairlift or ropeway. The castle is open almost every day of the year from 9 AM to around 5 PM and the admission fee is 510 yen. If you want to save yourself the steep climb on foot, the chairlift\/ropeway is 510 yen for the round trip.\nThe nearest tram stop to the bottom of the mountain is Okaido, which houses a shopping arcade. It's 10 minutes from JR Matsuyama station, and 11 minutes from Dogo Onsen hot spring. One trip costs 190 yen, and a day pass costs 400 yen.\n\nMatsuyama Castle is not to be confused with another castle of the same name located near Okayama.\n\nAs with itineraries that I have shared in the past:\n- There are two itineraries given for each mode of transit. One starts and ends in Tokyo for those coming into the country at Narita or Haneda Airport. The other starts and ends in Osaka for those utilizing Kansai Airport instead.\n- All itineraries are offered subject to the Jose's Japan Tips DISCLAIMER.\n\nIn the case of these journeys, I have opted to just provide rail itinerary suggestions.\n\nFrom Tokyo By Rail\n\nDay 1:\nIn the morning, depart from Tokyo's Shinjuku Station on the Azusa Limited Express from Tokyo to Matsumoto (2 1\/2-3 hours, 6,900 yen, no charge with Japan Rail Pass)\nVISIT MATSUMOTO CASTLE\nOnce your visit is complete, depart for Kyoto using two trains: The \u201cShinano\u201d limited express from Matsumoto to Nagoya, and the Tokaido Shinkansen from Nagoya to Kyoto. Connecting to the \u201cNozomi\u201d in Nagoya, the entire trip takes 3 hours and costs 10,170 yen. With a Japan Rail Pass, you will have to take the \u201cHikari\u201d, increasing the trip time by 30-45 minutes.\nSpend the night in Kyoto. Alternatively, continue 15 minutes along the line to Shin-Osaka to stay in that area.\n\nDay 2:\nIn the morning, depart for Himeji on the Shinkansen. From Kyoto the trip takes 45 minutes by direct Nozomi (5,590 yen) and up to 60 minutes using other services. For Japan Rail Pass holders, there are three Hikari services from Kyoto to Himeji departing between 7 AM and 8:30 AM, after which there is one direct service per hour. Otherwise you'll need to change trains in Shin-Osaka.\nVISIT HIMEJI CASTLE\nIn the afternoon, depart for Matsuyama using the bullet train and limited express across the Seto Sea to Shikoku. You'll need to take the bullet train a short distance from Himeji to Okayama, then board the \u201cShiokaze\u201d limited express from Okayama to Matsuyama. The trip takes approximately 3 1\/2 hours (9,570 yen). You can use the \u201cNozomi\u201d or the \u201cSakura\u201d depending on whether or not you have a rail pass, or your preference \u2013 both trains will offer ample connections to the Shiokaze.\n\nDay 3:\nGet up early to enjoy the historic hot springs and VISIT MATSUYAMA CASTLE.\nIn the afternoon, return to Okayama at your leisure using any of the \u201cShiokaze\u201d services (2 3\/4 hours, 6,830 yen) and spend the night in Okayama.\n\nDay 4:\nDepart for Hakata station in Fukuoka at your leisure and spend two nights in Fukuoka. Use the \u201cNozomi\u201d or \u201cMizuho\u201d unless you have a Rail Pass, in which case you'd use the \u201cHikari\u201d or \u201cSakura\u201d (1 3\/4-2 hours). Before leaving Okayama, you could visit Okayama Korakuen Garden, one of the top three Japanese gardens.\n\nDay 5:\nTake a day trip from Fukuoka to Kumamoto by Shinkansen, using the \u201cSakura\u201d or \u201cTsubame\u201d (40-50 minutes, 5,130 yen each way).\nVISIT KUMAMOTO CASTLE\n\nDay 6:\nTake the Shinkansen and return all the way to Tokyo at your leisure. By Nozomi it takes 5 hours and costs 22,950 yen with no change in trains necessary. With a Japan Rail Pass, the \u201cSakura\u201d and \u201cHikari\u201d will bring you to Tokyo in six hours, and you will need to change trains once.\n\nFor this itinerary, a 7 day Japan Rail Pass (29,110 yen) will save you a considerable amount of money compared to regular tickets. If you have an extra day left, why not stop at one or two other Japanese cities on the way back to Tokyo? Perhaps an overnight stopover?\n\nFrom Osaka by Rail\n\nDay 1:\nIn the morning, depart for Himeji on the Shinkansen. From Shin-Osaka the trip takes 30 minutes (3,740 yen). Remember if you have a Japan Rail Pass, you can't use the \u201cNozomi\u201d.\nVISIT HIMEJI CASTLE\nIn the afternoon, depart for Matsuyama using the bullet train and limited express across the Seto Sea to Shikoku. You'll need to take the bullet train a short distance from Himeji to Okayama, then board the \u201cShiokaze\u201d limited express from Okayama to Matsuyama. The trip takes approximately 3 1\/2 hours (9,570 yen). You can use the \u201cNozomi\u201d or the \u201cSakura\u201d depending on whether or not you have a rail pass, or your preference \u2013 both trains will offer ample connections to the Shiokaze.\n\nDay 2:\nGet up early to enjoy the historic hot springs and VISIT MATSUYAMA CASTLE.\nIn the afternoon, return to Okayama at your leisure using any of the \u201cShiokaze\u201d services (2 3\/4 hours, 6,830 yen) and spend the night in Okayama.\n\nDay 3:\nDepart for Hakata station in Fukuoka at your leisure and spend two nights in Fukuoka. Use the \u201cNozomi\u201d or \u201cMizuho\u201d unless you have a Rail Pass, in which case you'd use the \u201cHikari\u201d or \u201cSakura\u201d (1 3\/4-2 hours). Before leaving Okayama, you could visit Okayama Korakuen Garden, one of the top three Japanese gardens.\n\nDay 4:\nTake a day trip from Fukuoka to Kumamoto by Shinkansen, using the \u201cSakura\u201d or \u201cTsubame\u201d (40-50 minutes, 5,130 yen each way).\nVISIT KUMAMOTO CASTLE\n\nDay 5:\nIn the morning, make your way from Fukuoka all the way to Matsumoto, taking the Shinkansen to Nagoya then the \u201cShinano\u201d limited express to Matsumoto. Using the Nozomi, the trip takes 5 1\/2 hours (21,400 yen). With a Japan Rail Pass you'll need to take the \u201cSakura\u201d and \u201cHikari\u201d to Nagoya, changing trains once along the way. This increases the journey time to around 6 1\/2 hours.\nIf you don't want to spend time on trains for that long, you can optionally leave from Fukuoka on the evening of Day 4 and spend your evening in an intermediate city such as Kyoto or Nagoya. See my post on sample stopovers.\nSpend the evening in Matsumoto.\n\nDay 6:\nVISIT MATSUMOTO CASTLE in the morning. In the afternoon, return to Osaka by \u201cShinano\u201d and the Shinkansen (190 minutes and 10,810 yen by \u201cNozomi\u201d, slightly longer if switching to the \u201cHikari\u201d for Japan Rail Pass holders).\n\nFor this itinerary, once again a 7 day Japan Rail Pass (29,110 yen) is the way to go.","title":"Japan Itinerary: The *Four* Castles","media-type":"Blog","source":"Jose's Japan Tips","published":"2015-09-16T17:41:48Z"}

SAP Fiori requires significant upgrades to an exacting \"stack\" of SAP platform and application modules, including the implementation of SAP HANA. The Oracle Mobile Platform requires an arduous migration to Oracle Fusion architecture, middleware and applications. Both are based upon HTML5, which has renowned constraints in performance and user experience. Further, if you want to use their portfolio apps, you must modify them at the source code level to reflect the customizations you have made to their back-end applications. \n   \nStarMobile radically simplifies enterprise mobility by dynamically transforming any packaged on-premises (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Infor, etc.) or cloud-based application (e.g., Salesforce, Workday, etc.), or custom-built system (including legacy \"green-screen\" applications), and any workflow into a mobile app with a native user experience. Therein, StarMobile leverages the enterprise's existing investments in applications, workflows, infrastructure, data, and security without having to \"re-create\" them on each mobile device platform. StarMobile also provides the means to develop net new \"mobile first\" apps by connecting with APIs, data connectors, SQL, web services and mBaaS. \n\n\"SAP and Oracle have effectively abandoned their installed customers by using mobility as a means to force time consuming, complex and expensive upgrades upon them,\" said StarMobile President and CEO Todd Fryburger. \"StarMobile eliminates the need for such vendor-imposed upgrades. We allow SAP and Oracle customers to dynamically transform any application, without changes, for use on any endpoint, with a native user experience and integration with native device features. For about the cost of one cup of coffee per user per month, StarMobile provides the means for SAP and Oracle customers to mobilize their applications with speed, simplicity and economy that no other solution in the industry offers today.\" \n\nStarMobile customers, such as global consumer packaged goods company Mondel\u0113z International , use the StarMobile platform to create and deploy purpose-built mobile apps that leverage their existing SAP and Oracle applications. \n\n\"The StarMobile platform has enabled Mondel\u0113z to transform our existing investments in the systems and processes we use to run our business for use on mobile devices,\" said Carl Van Dusen, global head of mobility and integration at Mondel\u0113z International.  \"Anytime, anywhere access is essential to empowering our mobile workforce, and StarMobile allows us to deliver enterprise mobility quickly, simply and cost effectively.\" \n\nStarMobile was recently named a \"Cool Vendor in Mobile App Development, 2015\u2033 by Gartner and an Emerging Vendor by CRN.

The lowdown: Rugby World Cup 2015 The man who helped Jarryd Hayne break into the NFL is scouring the Rugby World Cup for the next cross-sport convert who can crack the United States market. As the Wallabies prepare to begin their World Cup campaign against Fiji in Cardiff, NFL agent Jack Bechta has made his intentions clear as he searches for a Hayne clone.\n\nHayne has made a remarkable transition from NRL superstar to NFL rookie with the San Francisco 49ers after he quit his Parramatta Eels deal last year.\n\nNow Bechta has his eyes on some new targets who are capable of breaking into the lucrative market.\n\n\"I'm actively scouting and trying to identify three to five guys who potentially fit the profile of an NFL player,\" Bechta told ESPN.\n\n\"Rugby players are better conditioned athletes than NFL players - from a toughness, training standpoint they won't have any problems making the transfer.\"\n\nWallabies fans can rest easy with prized possession Israel Folau recently committing to a new deal which will see him stay in Australian rugby.\n\nBut the Wallabies spent two weeks in the United States with many players showing their love of NFL with some slick moves on the training fields at Notre Dame.\n\nNFL talk has infiltrated the Wallabies camp with playmakers referred to as quarterbacks and assistant coach Stephen Larkham saying wingers were running backs.\n\n\"Only one out of every five or 10 will make it. It is a tough journey. It is more challenging than people think,\" Bechta said.\n\n\"It is the mental challenge of learning a new game ... In Hayne's case, I hired the best NFL former coaches and surrounded him with former players and gave him a crash course on the basics before we decided to sign him to a team.

He was also an England under 18 squad member.\u00a0 \n\nSpeaking about what he remembers of his accident, Matt told Express.co.uk: \"I don\u2019t remember much of the accident itself. We had a tough training session, ahead of the Friday when we were due to play the Scots.\u00a0 \n\n\"We went into live scrummaging. I remember hitting the scrum and the scrum collapsing, with me left at the bottom. I said 'I can\u2019t breathe! I can\u2019t breathe!' I was really worried, and realised couldn\u2019t feel my arms and legs. After that I blacked out.\" \n\nHe added: \"I remember waking up in the ambulance and the paramedics were cutting my England shirt off me. The only thing I was thinking was, 'That\u2019s my England shirt! Don\u2019t damage that!' I drifted in and out of consciousness with really frightening dreams.\u00a0 \n\n\"In between the dreams, I\u2019d wake up in Stoke Mandeville Hospital ward, seeing my family standing around me.\" \n\nLittle did Matt know his England shirt being ripped open was about to be the last of his worries - when the scrum collapsed it dislocated his neck, severing his spinal cord.\u00a0 \n\n\"Initially, it was difficult to come to terms with,\" he said. \"I had quite a few dark days. \n\n\"Going from being a young, fit sportsman, to not being able to move from the neck down was tough.\u00a0 \n\n\"The thing that was great for me was the support from my amazing family and friends. They didn\u2019t treat me any differently to before \u2013 to them I was just the same old Matt.\" \n\nSpeaking about being in hospital, he added: \"You don\u2019t think life is ever going to be the same again. Stoke Mandeville for me wasn\u2019t a very pleasant place.\u00a0 \n\n\"There were great people in there, who will be friends of mine for life; but some weren\u2019t as great. \n\n\"There was so much emotion going through my mind, but they didn\u2019t explain what was happening to me. They made you feel like a lump of meat, not a normal person \u2013 whatever normal is.\u00a0 \n\n\"I didn\u2019t have much support at Stoke Mandeville. I couldn\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel at times. It was tough.\" \n\nThis year marks a decade since the accident, which left Matt paralysed and a tetraplegic, dependent on a ventilator to breath.\u00a0 \n\nShowing incredible strength, tranquility and mental power, the former rugby star hasn't let his injuries consume him.\u00a0 \n\nIn fact, if anything Matt is stronger than ever and opening a new centre in Melton Mowbray to inspire children and their families to continue fighting after suffering a catastrophic injury.\u00a0 \n\nBut none of this would be as easy without his friends and former team mates helping him and giving their undying support.\u00a0 \n\nMatt explained: \"My old teammates are a still a massive part of my life, as well as of the Matt Hampson Foundation. They support me in everything I do.\u00a0 \n\n\"One of my best mates, Matt Cornwall, who was England Under 21\u2019s captain and is now team manager at Leicester Tigers, is a great guy and has constantly been a really positive influence.\u00a0 \n\n\"Then there are guys like James Haskell, Ben Foden, Toby Flood and others who I was playing alongside, who are always there for me and stay in touch. Rugby\u2019s a big family \u2013 you go to the same events and functions.\" \n\nHe added: \"Richard Cockerill once said to me that I\u2019ll always be a Leicester Tiger, and that they will support me for the rest of my life. What a fantastic club to do that. I\u2019m a life-member of the Tigers, and they help with everything I do, especially with the Foundation. It means a great deal to me.\" \n\nMatt is now focusing all his efforts on the Get Busy Living Centre. He said: \"I think it will be a really important place for people to come and share positive experiences with their families. We have so many different beneficiaries; so many unique talents.\u00a0 \n\n\"The Foundation can do amazing things with this new Centre, and it gives us a real focal-point.\" \n\nHe added: \"My attitude is that you need to live your life every day. You can\u2019t sit still and wait to be helped. You need to live every day, and try to achieve something every day.\u00a0 \n\n\"That\u2019s how I feel. Like we say at the Foundation, we want to Get Busy Living. That\u2019s the whole point of the Foundation \u2013 it\u2019s about being proactive, to do something productive with your life.\"","title":"'I was screaming \"I can't breathe!\"'  Tetraplegic rugby star Matt Hampson speaks out","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Express","published":"2015-09-28T15:01:00Z"}

The export price of crude oil, which contributes roughly 10 % to the total State budget revenue, in the first eight months of the year averaged only US$60 per barrel while the State budget estimates were approved on the basis of the then projected crude oil price of $100 per barrel.\n\nAccording to a forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil price in Q3 this year will hover around US$48.16 per barrel after inching up to US$49.16 in Q4 this year.\n\nThe average price will be $51 per barrel this year and $50.36 next year.\n\nAccording to Luong Van Khoi, head of the Centre for Socio-Economic Information and Forecast's World Economic Department under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, world oil prices will depend on the market supply and demand sources while chances of global economic recovery remain slim.\n\nStatistics from the Ministry of Finance showed that the country's revenue from crude oil exports in the first eight months of this year dropped by more than 34 % against the same period last year to only VND47.1 trillion ($2.09 billion).\n\nHot and cold\n\nHowever, experts said the crude oil price reduction in the global market would have both negative and positive effect on Vietnam's economy.\n\nAccording to Khoi, if oil price stays at US$50 per barrel and the devaluation of China's yuan and Vietnam's dong stays at 3 % each, Vietnam's economic growth will be up by 0.03 percentage points this year. Exports will also rise by 0.2 percentage points while imports will drop by 0.08 percentage points this year.However, the country's economic growth will come down by 0.15 percentage points next year, Khoi estimated. In case oil is priced at $40 per barrel and the devaluation of the yuan and the dong is also at 3 %, Vietnam's economic growth will be reduced by 0.45 percentage points this year and 0.58 percentage points next year, Khoi said, adding that the State budget revenue will be cut by VND2 trillion ($88.88 million) this year and VND13 trillion ($577.77 million) in 2016 as per these projections.\n\nHowever, Khoi said, if Vietnam can capitalise on opportunities from the oil price reduction to boost its domestic production by helping local producers cut input costs, revenue from corporate income tax will increase significantly, thus offsetting losses from reduced crude oil export revenue.\n\nIf the country can do that, Khoi said, Vietnam's economic growth would fall by only 0.03 percentage points this year before adding 0.34 percentage points next year.\n\nIn fact, the State budget revenue from local sources increased sharply in the first eight months, reaching VND459.45 trillion ($20.42 billion), up 16.5 % against the same period last year.\n\nAccording to Khoi, if oil prices hovered around $30 per barrel and the devaluation of the yuan and the dong is at 3 %, Vietnam's economic growth this year will drop by 0.95 percentage points, while next year it will drop by 1.08 percentage points. In this case, Vietnam's economy will also fall into a deflation with a rate of -0.3 % in 2015 and -0.6 % in 2016.\n\nThe State budget revenue in this case will also be reduced by VND5 trillion ($222.22 million) in 2015 and VND25 trillion ($1.11 billion) in 2016, Khoi said.\n\nHowever, economic growth will come down by only 0.02 percentage points in 2015 and then rise by 0.26 percentage points in 2016 if the country can capitalise on falling oil prices, Khoi estimates. \n\nVNS","title":"Vietnam's oil output seen rising 4.6%","media-type":"News","source":"VietNamNet Bridge","published":"2015-09-11T02:54:36Z"}

Instead, he\u2019ll go directly to a lunch with homeless people helped by Catholic charities. \n \nOn the third day of his visit to the United States, Francis, the first Jesuit pope, is expected to return to themes contained in his blunt address on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday, in which he tackled climate change, immigration, the need to respect religious liberty and President Barack Obama\u2019s opening to Cuba. \n \nMany of his views will likely clash with the entrenched partisan positions on Capitol Hill, where Republicans control both the House and the Senate. But he could put Democrats on the spot as well if he weighs in on abortion \u2014 an issue that will come up for a vote in the Senate later Thursday \u2014 and if he calls for traditional marriage to be protected. \n \nFrancis emerged from the residence of the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Washington on Thursday morning and greeted well wishers, including large numbers of children, waiting outside, before climbing into his now familiar Fiat hatchback car to travel to the U.S. Capitol. \n \nHe was greeted by Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a practicing Catholic, who was seen pacing in his office as he waited for the Pope. The Speaker greeted the pontiff with the words \u201cYour Holiness, welcome.\u201d \n \nLawmakers were already gathering in the House of Representatives to hear how directly he would address contentious political issues. The Argentine-born Pope introduced himself Wednesday at the White House as the \u201cson of an immigrant family,\u201d making clear his deep personal connection to an issue that has opened up bitter fault lines in the 2016 presidential race and within the Republican Party. \n \nFrancis will give his speech from the House of Representatives, with Boehner and Vice President Joe Biden sitting behind him. Francis is expected to greet crowds following an appearance on the Speaker\u2019s Balcony. \n \nChief Justice John Roberts, a devout Catholic, will attend the address, as will Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sonia Sotomayor, who also are Catholic. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish, will be in the audience, too. \n \nRepublican presidential candidates Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will also be in the House chamber. \n \nOn Wednesday, Francis signaled that he was ready to engage in politics as well as ministering to the Catholic Church\u2019s 70 million U.S. believers. \n \nHe told Obama it was \u201cencouraging\u201d the President was committed to battling climate change, saying the planet was at a \u201ccritical moment in history.\u201d \n \nHe also said that men and women of goodwill should redouble efforts to support the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, in comments seen as pushing his vision of a more inclusive vision of global capitalism. \n \nBut in a sign of disagreement with the president, Francis also visited nuns belonging to the Little Sisters of the Poor order that is currently suing the Obama administration for requiring contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. \n \nFrancis will travel to New York late Thursday afternoon and will wrap up his six-day visit to the United States in Philadelphia on Sunday.","title":"WATCH LIVE: Pope Francis delivers historic speech to Congress","media-type":"News","source":"WTVR-TV","published":"2015-09-24T14:06:02Z"}

The Angels used their fourth consecutive victory to remain half a game behind the Houston Astros, who hold the American League's second wild-card spot, and move within four games of the first-place Texas Rangers in the AL West.But Los Angeles might have lost closer Huston Street, who leads the AL with 40 saves. Street left the game in the top of the ninth after running to cover third base on a ground ball. As Street was running, he pulled up and was unable to put any weight on his left leg.Street, who faced only two batters and allowed one hit in one-third of an inning, is the second reliever to suffer an injury within the week. The Angels lost right-hander Joe Smith, their eighth-inning specialist, when he sprained his left ankle while walking down a hotel stairway Sept. 19.Freese, the first batter in the bottom of the ninth, powered an 89 mph fastball from right-hander Danny Farquhar (1-5) over the outstretched glove of center fielder Shawn O'Malley and the outfield fence for his 12th homer of the season.Right-hander Fernando Salas (4-2) picked up the victory in relief.The Mariners put the potential winning run at third base in the top of the ninth. Second baseman Robinson Cano began the inning by lining a single to right field. Pinch-runner Brad Miller replaced Cano, stole second base and moved to third when center fielder James Jones grounded out, the play on which Street suffered his injury.Left-hander Jose Alvarez replaced Street and induced pinch-hitter Seth Smith to hit a sharp ground ball that first baseman C.J. Cron dived to field. Miller moved to third when Cron threw to Alvarez for the out at first. Salas then relieved Alvarez and made catcher Jesus Sucre ground out to end the inning.The Angels loaded the bases twice in the bottom of the first inning against right-hander Felix Hernandez, the Mariners' 18-game winner, but had to settle for a 1-0 lead.Right fielder Kole Calhoun singled with one out and took second base on center fielder Mike Trout's infield single. After designated hitter Albert Pujols walked to load the bases, Calhoun scored on left fielder David Murphy's sacrifice fly. Los Angeles reloaded the bases when Cron reached on catcher's interference, but Hernandez defused the threat by striking out Freese.Seattle tied the score in the top of the second. Left fielder Franklin Gutierrez walked to begin the inning, moved to third on first baseman Jesus Montero's one-out double and scored when Sucre grounded out. In the bottom of the second, the Angels had a chance to re-take the lead but squandered more opportunities.Second baseman Johnny Giavotella tripled to right-center field with one out but when shortstop Erick Aybar tried to squeeze Giavotella home, Hernandez fielded the ball and used his glove to shovel to ball to Sucre for the tag. Then with the bases again loaded, Pujols ended the inning by grounding out. Mariners shortstop Ketel Marte made the Angels pay in the top of the third when he hit his first major-league home run. On a 1-1 count, Marte propelled Andrew Heaney's 83 mph changeup into the Angels' left-field bullpen to put Seattle ahead 2-1.Trout stole a second home run in the top of the fourth. When Montero pounded a deep fly ball to center field, Trout jumped, grabbed the top of the fence with his right hand, steadied himself and made a backhanded catch about three feet from the top of the fence in front of the 396-foot sign.After he threw the ball to the infield, Trout swung his right arm, pumped a fist and yelled \"Let's go!\" The fans responded by chanting \"M-V-P, M-V-P.\"Cron tied the score in the sixth with his 16th home run of the season. He hit Hernandez's 92 mph fastball off the top of the Cypress trees behind the center-field fence.NOTES: Seattle 3B Kyle Seager played his 627th game since 2012 on Saturday night, the most of any major leaguer at any position. ... Mariners DH Nelson Cruz gave his team 106 home runs on the road when he hit his 43rd of the season Friday night, the most for the club since 2000. Seattle leads the majors in road homers. ... Josh Byrnes, former general manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres, has emerged as a candidate for the Angels' vacant GM position. Byrnes currently works as the Los Angeles Dodgers' vice president of baseball operations. ... Angels 3B David Freese became the first player at his position to amass 10 doubles in a month for the club since Troy Glaus accomplished the feat in May 2001.

Dressing the part is only a starting point. To appear truly sophisticated this season, check out today's tips. \n \nStay ahead of the game \n \nWhether it's the upcoming weekly meeting at work or a weekend party, sophistication begins with just a little research. Appear ahead of the curve when you plan your day the day before, noting the who, what, when and where for whatever event is up on tomorrow's calendar. Want to really knock the ball out of the park? Go to your appointment five minutes early. \n \nTake a gift \n \nNo, it's not required. But nothing says class like someone who arrives on the scene with a bottle of wine, a seasonal candle or even just a plate of homemade cookies.

Add you own scrawling penmanship and a postage stamp, and you're bound to earn at least a few sophistication points for being kind and considerate. \n \nUtilize the Internet \n \nKnowing your facts, whether it's this morning's news or a few details about your favorite 18th century artist, gives you something to talk about in any social circumstance, helping you appear more approachable and knowledgeable.

In 2011 she caught the attention of the inimitable King Khan at a karaoke bar (he also lives in Berlin), and she recorded what's still her most recent full-length of new material, 2013's Eden, at his Moon Studios. He's not her only famous fan either: Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs contributed a quote to Ocher's press kit. \"Mary Ocher gives me the chills,\" she says. \"She frightens me with her feral soul. Her sound is of a true outsider artist, immaculately self-possessed. Was this recorded this century? Or out of a basement that's she's been imprisoned all her life?\"\nHer DIY roots and anything-goes aesthetic notwithstanding, Ocher is obviously too well-connected to qualify as an outsider.

Ocher's broad vibrato and wildly slewing pitch center make her piercing voice sound giddy and a little loopy, but she uses the occasional dramatic overenunciation of a terminal consonant to ground it in an aura of ritual pronouncement.\nIn March of this year, Ocher released a digital-only two-volume collection of home recordings dating back to 2006. The Fictional Biography of Mary Ocher\u00a0covers a dizzying amount of ground for music that sounds like it was made in a broom closet: its backing tracks include ghostly noise, sad but jaunty piano, frisky strumming, echoing ersatz funk, chintzy drum machine with vacuum-cleaner synth, and aimlessly gnawing distorted electric guitar. Ocher herself seems to have as many faces as a vaudeville performer: her multifarious singing leaps without warning from unhinged keening to warped drawling or from wobbly muttering to blustery declaiming.\nAmong tonight's openers is Gel Set, aka Laura \"Lulu\" Callier; I reviewed her first full-length, Human Salad, on the occasion of its release party in July.\u00a0Ocher will be selling copies of a second edition of Eden, both on golden cassette tapes and on vinyl.","title":"Self-described 'outsider torch singer' Mary Ocher performs at Analogue tonight","media-type":"Blog","source":"Chicago Reader","published":"2015-09-10T17:00:00Z"}

God reportedly told Joyner \"don't give up on the Panthers,\" which Joyner interpreted to mean that the Panthers would not have a very good year but \"it could end up good,\" which is exactly what happened when the team made it into the playoffs despite having a losing record and even won a Wild Card game. But more importantly, God told Joyner that the Patriots would win the Super Bowl, though Joyner wisely decided not to share that information publicly because otherwise people would have used it to gamble. \"The Lord told me the Patriots were going to win,\" he said. \"I knew the Lord said and he was saying it as a prophetic message that patriotism is going to win this year.\u00a0 And that's what's going to win and you're going to see Americans becoming patriotic again.

In the comment they referenced their police safety banner product and how it has been shown to be highly effective in identifying off-duty or undercover police officers who take police action in civilian clothing, especially in low-light situations. \n \nThese banners are lightweight, and have reflective lettering, and can be folded or rolled up to fit inside a pocket. I had briefly heard about these banners in the past, and was glad to hear from Michael Lessman of DSM Products. This safety banner has huge potential in properly identifying police officers in civilian clothes, and avoiding the unthinkable blue on blue accidental shooting of off-duty officers by on-duty officers who see a subject armed with a firearm. As such, I wanted to pass along some information on this beneficial piece of law enforcement equipment. \n \n\n \nThe DSM identification banners are lightweight, easily stored and carried, and quickly provide positive identification for civilian clothed officers. \n \nDSM Police Safety Banners \n \nDSM Products began in 2007 when a SWAT Sergeant realized during the major influx into Active Shooter training, there was no adequate and viable solution to identifying off-duty officers or officers in civilian clothing that had responded to assist. The DSM Safety Banner, with its bright ANSI green (looks more yellow) background and reflective lettering, was developed to provide these civilian clothed officers a near 360-degree identification. \n \nThese banners stand out both day and night, just like the traffic safety vests that officers wear when on a crash scene. The reflective borders and lettering will provide a very clear identification\u00a0to the introduction of any light, making civilian clothed officers much more safe when performing duties in that dress. \n \nThis is a serious potential in a rapidly evolving critical incident. The DSM banner can mean the difference between success and tragedy. \n \nThe banners can be easily deployed by simply unfolding and looping the banner over the officer\u2019s neck and one arm. Because of their lightweight and fabric type material, the safety banners can also be stored very easily and quickly in a small location. \n \nThe DSM safety banner has two distinct deployments: \n  Post-Critical Incident Deployment\u00a0 \u2013 putting the bad guy down, seeking cover, tactically reloading and deploying the DSM Safety Banner to identify yourself to arriving law enforcement units. (The gunfight finds you mode)  Pre-Critical Incident Deployment \u2013 Before placing yourself into a critical incident, deploy your DSM Safety Banner so your not misidentified by possible law enforcement officers on scene already. (You find the gunfight mode)   \nThe DSM Law Enforcement Safety Banners options: \n \n\n \nLessons From the KCPD Badge Placement Study \n \nAs you may remember, the KCPD Badge Placement Study was conducted in 2011 and 2012 by the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department. The Firearms Unit of KCPD included various targets of plain clothed officers among the actual \u201cthreat\u201d targets. An exact replica of the KCPD badge (with correct size) was placed on the plain clothed officer targets on the waist line and on an imaginary neck chain hanging at the \u201cofficer\u2019s\u201d chest. \n \nUltimately, the study revealed that officers were initially focusing only on the firearm when deciding to shoot. After intense training, officers learned to make split second scans of the targets to see if there was a badge or other form of identification. Accidental shootings of plain clothed officers dropped significantly, and were particularly reduced for targets wearing badges at chest level \u2013 on neck chains . This led to KCPD issuing a department-wide mandate for officers in civilian clothes to wear badges around their neck and not on their waist band. \n \n\n \nDespite this study and training model being a great benefit to plain clothed and uniformed officers alike, the placement of a badge still does not provide 360-degree identification, and is still hindered in low-light conditions. The DSM Police Safety Banner seeks to fill that void with near 360-degree identification in highly reflective material. \n \nThe Effects of a Blue-on-Blue Shooting \n \nA blue-on-blue shooting is devastating in many ways. The officer who is shot could suffer life-altering injuries or death. Their family will suffer along with their loved one. The officer who shot the other officer will undoubtedly suffer immense psychological trauma, and a strong sense of isolation. \n \nOfficers are expected to get things right, and shooting another officer is a tremendous blow to the trust officers need to function. Many officers who shoot another officer, leave police work within a short time, and some have even ended their lives over the mistake. \n \n\n \nThe Department suffers with the loss of multiple officers \u2013 the injured or killed officer, and the officer who fired the shot. Entire shifts can be effected as officers inevitably take sides of who was more at fault for the shooting. If the shooting crosses agency lines, a very real possibility in an active shooter or critical incident with multiple agencies responding, the effects can be even worse. Entire departments end relationships, and in some cases open hostilities emerge. \n \nFinal Thoughts \n \nThere is no doubt the DSM Police Safety Banner can provide a superior form of identification for officers in civilian clothing. In addition to wearing a badge at chest level, the DSM identification banner is a quick reference identification in both daylight and low-light situations. These banners should be seriously considered by any agency. \n \nBlueSheepDog is a strong proponent of officers carrying their firearms and handcuffs at all times when off-duty . We would also highly recommend that officers purchase some form of positive identification in the event they have to take action during a time when they are in civilian dress. The DSM Police Safety Banner is a great consideration for that purpose.","title":"DSM Safety Products \u2013 Off-Duty Police Identification Banner","media-type":"Blog","source":"Blue Sheepdog","published":"2015-09-06T19:43:59Z"}

We have cardinals year round, but on Sunday, we had them in particularly high concentration, with as many as 10 visible within a 200-square-foot area.\n\nWe've been fortunate in recent years to have a nesting pair of painted buntings nearby, which frequent our feeders. Lately, we've seen only the female and figured the male had departed for post-breeding dispersal. We had it half right, anyway.\n\nThe adult male has indeed been absent from the feeder, but we noticed that it wasn't two females that continued to feed. Rather, it was one female and two male juveniles that are just now distinguishable at casual glance. This weekend, we noticed for the first time that what we thought was a female was actually a pair of juveniles, which are now transitioning into adult plumage.\n\nThis weekend brought other interesting sights.\n\nI decided to haul out my GoPro, which hadn't been turned on in a while, and position it near a hummingbird feeder. While capturing the video of a feeding ruby-throated hummingbird that is included with this post, I noticed how many other birds had gathered. At one time, I could turn my head 45 degrees and see in my yard cardinals, painted buntings, hummingbirds, tufted titmice, a white-breasted nuthatch, mourning doves, a Carolina wren and a Carolina chickadee. As the buntings flew away, a red-bellied woodpecker and a downy woodpecker flew in to feed on suet. About that time, I heard (but never saw) blue jays in a neighbor's water oaks.\n\nThen a pine warbler -- a species we have not typically seen in our yard until at least October -- plopped down on a feeder.\n\nCan goldfinches and yellow-rumped warblers be far behind?","title":"Backyard birds: A time of transition around the feeders","media-type":"News","source":"Beaufort Gazette","published":"2015-09-14T12:24:00Z"}

This agreement marks Amadeus\u2019 continued expansion of its airport IT business in the Asia Pacific region, with Perth Airport its first customer in Australia. \n\nThe next generation, cloud-based ACUS solution will make use of application virtualisation, allowing passenger processing systems to be accessed and deployed anywhere, on demand. This means airlines can use the platform from a desktop computer, laptop or mobile device, and enables passengers to be checked-in and boarding passes to be printed from any location. \n\nGround handlers will also be able to handle passenger processing for multiple airlines at the same time from any gate or terminal and from any device. \n\nAny combination of applications can be hosted without any constraint or limitation on the actual workstation or device. The common use platform will also simplify user training, allowing for the rapid deployment of new employees. \n\nThe infrastructure and hardware reduction also means that Amadeus\u2019 environmentally-friendly platform is expected to help Perth Airport reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and improve its environmental footprint. \n\nRowan Chalmers, Perth Airport Executive General Manager Operations and Customer Experience said that  this partnership  will put Perth Airport in a more proactive, reliable and flexible position when it comes to the check-in process. \n\n\u201cThe advanced systems we are delivering with Amadeus will provide a higher level of customer experience. During our selection process, it became clear that Amadeus was the only common use provider to truly deliver on the cloud-based model, bringing clear financial and structural benefits,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n\nThe investment in technology aligns with Perth Airport\u2019s AUD$1 billion overall transformation of infrastructure. \n\n\u201cMoving to the Amadeus\u2019 cloud-based common use system means we will be able to cut passenger processing costs by more than 25 per cent for our airline partners. That was a key consideration when selecting this new and innovative system,\u201d Chalmers said.\u00a0 \n\nCaroline Wilkie, Chief Executive Officer, Australian Airports Association said the introduction of the Amadeus platform was another example of how Australian airports were investing in the latest technology to deliver better and more flexible services for passengers and airlines. \n\n\u201cAs Australian airports continue to handle ever increasing numbers of passengers and aircraft movements, their adoption of innovative technology solutions will help in providing a better experience for passengers while also meeting the operational needs of their airline customers,\u201d Wilkie said. \n\n\u201cAirports across the world are under pressure to think differently in order to handle increasingly significant numbers of passengers, and modern technology has a huge role to play. The deployment of ACUS is only the beginning of our partnership with Perth Airport, and we look forward to continuing to work closely together,\u201d said John Jarrell, Head of Airport IT, Amadeus. \n\nThis partnership follows the launch of ACUS at Innsbruck Airport, announced in February and the major deal signed with The Avinor Group in June to adopt ACUS in the airports it operates in Norway.","title":"Perth Airport adopts Amadeus' cloud technology to...","media-type":"News","source":"Network World Asia","published":"2015-09-02T14:35:01Z"}

Although most of these results are rather direct applications of some recent results, using linear structures (linear translators) allows us to have certain flexibilities to control extra properties of these plateaued functions. In the second part of the paper, using the results of the first part and exploiting these flexibilities, we modify many secondary constructions. Therefore, we obtain new secondary constructions of bent and semi-bent functions not belonging to the Maiorana-McFarland class. Instead of using bent (semi-bent) functions as ingredients, our secondary constructions use only Boolean (vectorial Boolean) functions with linear structures (linear translators) which are very easy to choose. Moreover, all of them are very explicit and we also determine the duals of the bent functions in our constructions. We show how these linear structures should be chosen in order to satisfy the corresponding conditions coming from using derivatives and quadratic\/cubic functions in our secondary constructions.","title":"Bent and semi-bent functions via linear translators , by N.

Federal authorities have charged a U.S. Border Patrol agent who killed a Mexican teenager in a cross-border shooting with second-degree murder. Luis Parra, the attorney for the mother of Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, told The Associated Press that a federal grand jury on Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2015, indicted agent Lonnie Swartz. (Kelly Presnell\/Arizona Daily Star via AP,File) ALL LOCAL TELEVISION OUT; PAC-12 OUT; MANDATORY CREDIT; GREEN VALLEY NEWS OUT; MANDATORY CREDIT\" \n  \nTUCSON, Ariz. - A Border Patrol agent has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of a Mexican teenager who was shot from the U.S. side of the border in 2012. \n\nLonnie Swartz was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury that reviewed the death of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who was shot about 10 times. \n\nThe Border Patrol has said that Elena Rodriguez was among a group of rock throwers endangering agents' lives. His family insists the boy was walking home from a basketball game with friends and was not armed or hurling rocks. \n\nLuis Parra, the attorney for the boy's mother, said the family was grateful to the Department of Justice \"for this first step in the pursuit of justice,\" and they \"remain steadfast in their resolve to seek full transparency\" from the Border Patrol. \n\nSwartz's attorney, Sean Chapman, did not respond to a call seeking comment. He told The Arizona Daily Star that he expects his client to plead not guilty at an Oct. 9 arraignment. The U.S. Attorney's Office did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nSwartz also faces a federal civil rights lawsuit in the death of the teen, who was in Nogales, Sonora, on Oct. 10, 2012, when Swartz fired from Nogales, Arizona. \n\nThe case happened amid criticism that the Border Patrol uses force indiscriminately, a charge the agency has denied. Border Patrol agents are generally allowed to use lethal force against rock throwers because rocks can be deadly. Rock throwers have attacked agents more than 1,700 times since 2010, according to the agency. \n\nChapman tried to get the family's lawsuit thrown out on the grounds that the Constitution does not apply to the boy, a Mexican citizen, because he was in Mexico at the time of the shooting. \n\nA federal judge in July ruled that the lawsuit can go forward. \n\nIn a similar case in Texas, a federal appeals court ruled that a teen killed in Mexico by a border agent in El Paso, Texas, was not protected by the Constitution. \n\nBorder Patrol agent Jesus Mesa Jr. shot 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca in 2010 near a bridge between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. \n\nAuthorities said Mesa was trying to arrest immigrants who had illegally crossed into the country when rock throwers attacked him. Mesa fired his weapon across the Rio Grande, striking the teen twice. \n\nA three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals originally said Hernandez Guereca's family could sue Mesa. But the full court overturned that ruling in April. \n \nContent Provided By Canadian Press.","title":"Border Patrol agent indicted in fatal 2012 shooting of teenager along Arizona-Mexico border","media-type":"News","source":"1057 EZRrock","published":"2015-09-24T18:38:29Z"}

Shares have fallen 25% over the past 12 months, whereas the S&P 500 is down 2.25%. \n \nAberle said investors calling for a split are taking a \"sum of the parts\" analysis and believe Qualcomm's two divisions \u2212 its highly profitable licensing arm and its chips unit \u2212 would be valued more highly as independent companies. \n \n\"You have to step back and say why is that and would a separation actually solve whatever the underlying issues are that are creating the current valuation?\" he said. \"You have to be careful that it's not too simplistic an analysis.\" \n \nThe company's current structure, Aberle said, also allows Qualcomm to leverage relationships with Chinese customers, since the chipmaker is well-positioned to help them expand to other countries. \nAt the same time, Aberle acknowledged that having both a chips and a licensing division has at times created conflicts with customers, \"but we manage it pretty well\". \nDealing with Jana \n \nJana in April unleashed a public campaign to reform Qualcomm, calling its chip business \"essentially worthless\" at current valuations and pressing the company to spin it off or pursue strategic mergers or acquisitions. \n \nAberle said when Qualcomm was approached by Jana, the hedge fund which owned $2\u00a0billion in stock did not pressure it to pursue a breakup but rather wanted the company to review a split as one option to unlock value. \n \nIt is also working on adding a third independent board member, whom Aberle declined to name. Qualcomm has already added two new board members in cooperation with Jana. \n \n\"A lot of the things [Jana] put on the table were very consistent with things we'd already been talking to our shareholders about and already been planning for a long time,\" Aberle said. \n \nQualcomm said in July it would reduce costs by about $1.4\u00a0billion, cut about 4\u00a0500 full-time staff, or 15% of its workforce, and boost capital returns to shareholders.","title":"Qualcomm split may not create value","media-type":"News","source":"IT Web","published":"2015-09-04T08:56:00Z"}
{"id":"987b0468-955c-415d-acb3-53f78486f61f","content":"This marks the first time a DPO has been used for a desalination project and made the purchase of dividend-yielding shares available to the general public. Profits from the sale of water will be distributed through a dividend to preferred shareholders. \"We can shape the future when it comes to water and this public offering allows professional investors, as well as individuals, to directly participate in delivering a sustainable source of water in California ,\" said Aaron Mandell , Chairman of WaterFX and Member of the Board of HydroRevolution SM . \"Being a part of this water revolution will provide more than just a financial return, it will put California on a course towards water independence,\" continued Mr. Mandell.\u00c2\u00a0 \n \nThe DPO is a State of California registered Qualification by Permit (permit #3499), regulated through the Department of Business Oversight. This investment platform enables HydroRevolution SM to sell shares to both accredited and non-accredited investors in California . The company is issuing $10 million of preferred equity and anticipates raising $20 million in debt financing for the construction of the project. In keeping with the company's open source philosophy, participation in the HydroRevolution project is open to the California public and the company will be majority owned by California residents upon close of the campaign. The investment is also open to organizations, foundations and corporations based in California . \n \nThe company is offering up to 2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred stock at a price of $5 per share. The HydroRevolution DPO has several investment benefits, including a fixed annual yield, just like a public stock dividend, and protections that ensure proceeds are only deployed for construction of the plant. The minimum investment in HydroRevolution SM is $2,000 (400 shares) for non-accredited investors and $5,000 (1,000 shares) for accredited investors. The stock is non-voting and provides a 6% annual dividend. Proceeds from the DPO are to be held in a third party managed impound account until the company meets pre-determined conditions. The DPO campaign will run for a period of up to one year, but may be terminated early once the offering has been fully subscribed. \n \nThe HydroRevolution SM plant is the first commercial solar desalination plant to be constructed in California . At full scale, the plant will occupy up to 100 acres of land in the Panoche Water and Drainage District and produce 5,000 acre-feet of freshwater per year, enough water to satisfy 10,000 homes or irrigate 2,000 acres of cropland. The system is capable of treating water with greater than 90% recovery rate, isolating salt and mineral by-products for downstream commercial uses. The plant expands on the demonstration project operated by WaterFX\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 in 2013 in the Panoche Water and Drainage District. The expansion will utilize clean, solar energy to treat irrigation drainage water from 6,000 acres of salt-impaired cropland and generate a new supply of freshwater for the district. WaterFX is providing the technology for the project and will service and operate the plant through a partnership with ATSI Engineering.\u00c2\u00a0 \n \nUnlike conventional desalination plants, HydroRevolution SM will not treat seawater; rather it will draw from a replenishing supply of shallow irrigation water, known as subsurface drainage water, which has previously been unusable. Irrigation drainage water is a natural consequence of agricultural activities but poses a serious threat to cropland, wildlife and waterways in the Central Valley as its high salinity content can damage freshwater ecosystems. By treating this source of water, HydroRevolution SM will help farmers solve two difficult problems: obtaining a consistent and reliable source of freshwater and restoring impaired ecosystems. Without this solution, an additional 10% of farmland in California will have to be retired every year to create additional storage for untreated drainage water. \n \nBehind the HydroRevolution SM plant is the Aqua4\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology, a concentrated solar still developed by WaterFX\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, that harnesses the energy from the sun to produce thermal energy, which powers the distillation process. As the solar receivers capture solar thermal energy, mineral oil is heated and carries thermal energy to the heat pump that optimizes energy efficiency and feeds heat to a multi-effect distillation system (MED). The MED evaporates freshwater from the water source and the condensate is recovered in the form of purified water.

NIU officials hope that by then the state has adopted a budget so the school can finalize its financial plan. \n\n\u201cIn most years we [NIU] would have a budget by July 1, but we don\u2019t,\u201d NIU President Doug Baker said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a state budget by July 1. So when we put this together, we had to put it together with our best estimates of what our revenues are going to be.\u201d \n\nThe budget estimates the university will lose $27.2 million in state funding this fiscal year, which ends June 30. It anticipates $63.9 million in general state aid, down from $91.1 million last year. \n\nUniversity officials said they\u00a0want to hold off making any moves that affect staffing, but the budget approved Thursday has a $29.8 million gap between revenue and operating expenses, according to university data. \n\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in May vetoed a Democrat-backed budget plan that included appropriations for all of the state\u2019s nine public universities. That budget called for an 8 percent state funding cut. Rauner has proposed cutting state funding for higher education aid by 30 percent. \n\nThe difference between Democrats\u2019 proposal and Rauner\u2019s is about $22 million, NIU Vice President of Administration and Finance Alan Phillips said. \n\n\u201cWe do not have any idea what our appropriation will be from the state,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make any firm decisions on spending until you know what your budget is actually going to be.\u201d \n\nThe governor and Democrat-led General Assembly remain at loggerheads as the state has moved into its third month without a budget. Without the state spending plan, NIU is among the legion of entities left in financial limbo wondering how much it will be appropriated. \n\n\u201cThese are unprecedented cuts,\u201d NIU Trustee John Butler, the board\u2019s vice chairman, said. \n\nTrustees expressed concern Thursday that the interim budget could push the university into deficit spending. The $389.4 million plan it approved was $29.9 million less than its expected operating expenses. \n\nThe Academic Affairs department had the greatest expenses, according to budget information presented to trustees. The department, which includes the colleges of business, education and law, as well as libraries and\u00a0NIU\u2019s graduate school, expects to spend $189.3 million, more than double that of Student Affairs, which handles student services such as housing and admissions. \n \nNIU is the largest employer in DeKalb County. The school, Illinois\u2019 third largest public university, has a staff of more than 1,100 faculty and more than 3,400 nonfaculty workers. Phillips said that if the school doesn\u2019t know by year-end what state money it will receive \u2013 and actually start to have it roll in \u2013 there could be furloughs or layoffs. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in process of cutting back in areas that we can, short of personnel,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe last thing we want to do is cut personnel.\u201d \n\nIn the previous fiscal year, NIU made 161 hires, including its first diversity chief. Vernese Edghill-Walden started Aug. 3 with a base salary of $185,000. The university also lost 389 employees to retirement and terminations, according to NIU spokesman Joe King. \n\nThe university\u2019s payroll includes Baker\u2019s $450,000 base salary. Football coach Rod Carey makes just less than Baker\u2019s salary at $408,000, with his boss, Associate Vice President and Athletic Director Sean Frazier at $280,000. \n\nThis summer, several NIU staffers decided to unionize. Most of those employees looking to join the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees earn less than $50,000, according to NIU data. The school cited budget constraint for not giving them raises. \n\nGeneral state aid payments will stop coming in after this week, when Phillips said NIU received its final fiscal 2015 disbursement. \n\nThat approximately $8 million payout could be the last of the checks cut to the school until a new budget is in place. \n\nBut there were bright sides to be considered, NIU Trustee Cherilyn Murer said, pointing out that the school needs to start moving away from dependence on general state aid, which represents about 20 percent of its budget. Murer suggested increasing research to help forge more corporate partnerships. \n\nThis year\u2019s budget plan calls for spending $4.8 million on research and partnerships. \n\n\u201cOnly with optimism do we have growth,\u201d Murer said. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking at things in too dismal a fashion, we will become paralyzed.

The Hong Kong police and Justice Department also did not respond to requests for comment. \n \nThe Independent Police Complaints Council has said previously it was reviewing complaints from the protests. \n \nMonday marks the one-year anniversary of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, during which activists blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to demand open nominations for the city's next chief executive election in 2017. \n \nWhile largely peaceful, the size and duration of the protests - and the fact that they took place in full view of international media, who filmed the activists using umbrellas to defend themselves against police tear gas, pepper spray and batons - raised a serious challenge to China's Communist Party, which has been tightening control over civil society. \n \nCiting the need to buttress national security and stability, President Xi Jinping's administration has tightened government control over almost every aspect of civil society since 2012. \n \nIt has adopted a sweeping new national security law, launched a months-long campaign in state media to discredit human rights activists for undermining national stability by using social media, and recently detained dozens of lawyers and activists. \n \nAccording to the Amnesty report, Chinese activist Sun Feng, who tried to travel to Beijing with his own proposal for Hong Kong electoral reform, and five others - Su Changlan, Chen Qitang, Wang Mo, Xie Wenfei and Zhang Shengyu - face up to 15 years in prison. \n \nActivist Ji Sizun faces up to 10 years in prison and Ye Xiaozheng faces up to five. \n \nSu said she was denied adequate medical treatment and Zhang said he was beaten and chained to a bed for 15 days, according to the report which cited the activists' lawyers. \n \nPresident Xi is returning to China from a state visit to the United States. \n \n(Reporting by Clare Baldwin; Additional reporting by Stella Tsang; Editing by Tom Heneghan)","title":"Rights group demands Chinese supporters of HK democracy be freed","media-type":"News","source":"Town Hall","published":"2015-09-27T16:11:05Z"}

This week trumpeted the fact the federal budget had returned to surplus a year earlier than predicted. \n \n\"The other parties are trying to tell us they will deal with the challenges of our economy, of our labor market, of international markets, by raising taxes and running deficits to finance vastly increased amounts of spending,\" he told a televised debate about the economy. \n \n\"That is not the way to protect our economy in this environment,\" he said in often testy exchanges with New Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair, 60, and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, 43. \n \nHarper says Canada should stick to Conservative policies designed to keep taxes low and attract investment. He brushes off calls for more government spending. \n \nThe Liberals are proposing to run budget deficits for three years to help finance a major national infrastructure program. \n \n\"Mr Harper wants to hit the snooze button while Mr Trudeau is hitting the panic button,\" said Mulcair. His party - which has never held power federally - said this week it would raise the corporate tax rate.. \n \nThe debate, the second of the campaign, was sponsored by the Globe and Mail newspaper. \n \nIt took place in Harper's adopted hometown of Calgary in the western energy-producing province of Alberta, which has been hard hit by slumping crude prices. \n \nMulcair accused Harper of relying far too much on oil exports to buoy government finances. The price of crude has dropped by more than half since mid-2014. \n \n\"Mr. Harper put all his eggs in one basket and then he dropped the basket,\" he said. \n \nTrudeau said Harper had presided over the worst growth rate of any prime minister since the Great Depression. \n \n\"Canadians are worried about their jobs, and that's what this election is about,\" said Trudeau. \n \nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May, who performed well in the first televised encounter, was left off the roster and could only offer commentary on Twitter.","title":"Stephen Harper bashes rivals over economy at second leaders' debate","media-type":"News","source":"Kingston Whig-Standard","published":"2015-09-18T01:41:54Z"}

This procedure allows the doctor to treat the damaging effects of periodontal disease with less invasive techniques.\n\nBarrie, ON (PRWEB) September 16, 2015 \n\nDr. Adam Tan, a dentist with a special interest in periodontics, is honoring Self-Improvement Month this September by encouraging patients with receding gums in Barrie, ON, to undergo the Chao Pinhole \u00ae Surgical Technique (PST). This type of procedure becomes necessary when periodontal disease progresses to such a degree, where the gums have receded to a detrimental point, or no longer cover the gums sufficiently. If the condition is ignored, the risk increases for loosened or lost teeth.\n\nPeriodontal disease is a serious condition that affects millions of Canadians every year. If the teeth are not properly cared for with daily brushing and flossing, bacteria can infect the gums, consistently leaving open wounds that worsen over time. As the disease progresses, recession can occur and immediate action may be necessary to prevent the condition from worsening. Receding gums may cause many patients in Barrie, ON, to experience increased pain and sensitivity, without prompt treatment.\n\nPST can help treat the effects of gum disease by bringing the gums back to their original position, covering the roots of the teeth. This is traditionally remedied by utilizing extremely invasive and uncomfortable measures, such as gum grafting and surgery. In these procedures, tissue is extracted from the roof of the mouth to graft onto the gums, covering any visible root. This involves an extensive healing period and may be prove to be incredibly painful. Conversely, PST requires no cutting or sutures, and is completed in as little as an hour, depending on the number of teeth that require treatment. During the procedure, Dr. Tan simply uses small, specialized tools, to manipulate the gums accordingly into their proper position.\n\nBernie, ON, patients who would like to take advantage of Self-Improvement Month, by visiting Dr. Tan for treatment of their receding gums, can visit his website for additional information about the technique. Those with periodontal disease are especially encouraged to call and initiate the route to better oral health today.\n\nAbout the Doctor\n\nGeorgian Dental is a general practice providing personalized dental care for patients in Barrie and Orillia, ON. Dr. Adam Tan received his Doctorate of Dental Medicine from the Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine. Dr. Tan is among the first group of periodontists and dentists in the country to undergo the training required to perform the Chao Pinhole Surgical Technique, a new minimally invasive alternative to traditional gum grafting surgery. Dr. Tan is the best-selling co-author of Healthy Input: America\u2019s Leading Dentists Reveal the Secret Truths to a Healthy Body, Starting with What You Put in Your Mouth, which features advice and practices from leading dental experts.

Subsequent to the activation of the NAB on April 1, 2011, amounts available under Fund bilateral borrowing and note purchase agreements of NAB participants include only those needed to cover financing of commitments under arrangements approved by the Fund prior to April 1, 2011 based on the current 1:1 bilateral borrowed to quota resources financing ratio for such commitments; undrawn balances under bilateral agreements of other creditors not included in the NAB are available to finance all (both pre- and post-NAB) commitments. Effective April 1, 2013 the board approved termination of any further drawings under these Fund bilateral borrowing and note purchase agreements, which were concluded in 2009\/2010 prior to activation of the NAB. \r Uncommitted usable \n\r\nresources \r \r Usable resources less the full amount of undrawn balances under GRA lending commitments. \r Forward commitment capacity \r \r A measure of the resources available for new financial commitments, equal to uncommitted usable resources plus repurchases one-year forward less repayments of borrowing due one-year forward and less the prudential balance. As of April 1, 2011, reflects activation of the expanded NAB for the first activation period through end-September 2011 and subsequent six-month activation periods thereafter. \r \u00a0\r \r \u00a0\r PRG Trust \r \r Trust administered by the IMF to conduct concessional lending operations through the Loan, Reserve and Subsidy Accounts. \r Available loan resources \r \r Loan Account resources committed by lenders to the PRG Trust. \r Cumulative commitments, net \r \r Cumulative commitments to borrowers, net of unused amounts under arrangements which have expired or have been canceled. \r Of which: Cumulative disbursements \r \r Disbursements to borrowers under PRGT arrangements. \r Uncommitted loan resources \r \r Available PRGT loan resources less commitments made to eligible member countries. \r \u00a0\r \r \u00a0\r Financial Assistance \r \r \u00a0\r GRA \r \r The General Resources Account (GRA) contains IMF holdings of members\u2019 currencies, SDRs, gold, and other assets.

These repurchases add to the supply of the IMF\u2019s usable resources. \r Repayments of borrowings \n\r\none-year forward \r \r Repayment obligations on Fund borrowing and note placements in the coming one-year period, including drawings and notes reaching final maturity in the next 12 months plus any encashment requests for early repayment to be met over that same period. \r Prudential balance \r \r Amount set aside to safeguard the liquidity of members\u2019 claims and take account of the potential erosion of the IMF\u2019s resource base. The prudential balance is set at 20 percent of the quotas of members participating in the financing of IMF transactions (Financial Transactions Plan) and any amounts made available under active bilateral borrowing and note purchase agreements. The prudential balance currently does not cover the encashment needs of NAB participants\u2019 outstanding claims under bilateral borrowing agreements that are to be folded into the NAB. Nor does it extend to the claims of participants in the expanded NAB, as such resources are to be provided by setting aside a portion of the total credit arrangements under the NAB. The prudential ratio of 20 percent as decided by the IMF\u2019s Executive Board reflects historical experience and judgments on the indicative level of uncommitted usable resources that the IMF would normally not use to make financial commitments. The prudential balance does not represent a rigid minimum and IMF resources could, on a strictly temporary basis, fall below this level. \r  Table 3a.

Purchases under Stand-By Arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3\u00bc - 5 years after disbursement. \r Extended Arrangements \r \r Extended Arrangements provide credit for a longer period since these arrangements usually require fundamental reforms which may need more time to put in place and take effect. Drawings under extended arrangements are repayable in 12 semiannual installments 4\u00bd - 10 years after disbursement. \r Flexible Credit Line \r \r The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) has been established to allow members with very strong track records to access IMF resources based on pre-set qualification criteria to deal with all types of balance of payments problems. The FCL could be used both on a precautionary (crisis prevention) and nonprecautionary (crisis resolution) basis. Members may request either a one-year arrangement with no interim reviews, or a two-year arrangement with an interim review of qualification required after twelve months. Upon expiration, the Fund may approve additional FCL arrangements for the member. Access is determined based on individual country financing needs and is not subject to a pre-set cap. Purchases under FCL arrangements are repayable in 8 quarterly installments 3\u00bc - 5 years after disbursement. \r Precautionary and Liquidity Line \r \r The Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), which replaces the Precautionary Credit Line (PCL), has been established to meet actual or potential balance of payments needs of members with sound economic fundamentals and institutional policy frameworks but with some remaining vulnerabilities that preclude them from using the FCL. Access under a PLL arrangement varies depending on the duration of the arrangement and member-specific needs. PLL arrangements can have a duration of either six months or one to two years. Under a six-month arrangement, access would not exceed 250 percent of a member\u2019s quota, which could be augmented to a maximum of 500 percent in exceptional circumstances where the member faces a balance of payments need that is of a short-term nature and results from exogenous shocks, including from heightened regional or global economic stress conditions. For one to two year arrangements, the maximum access upon approval is equal to 500 percent of a member\u2019s quota for the first year and up to 1000 percent of quota for the second year (the latter of which could also be brought forward to the first year where needed, following a Board review). One to two year arrangements are subject to Executive Board reviews every six months. \r PRG Trust \r \r \u00a0\r ECF Arrangements \r \r Concessional arrangements providing credit in support of a three-year macroeconomic and structural adjustment program to eligible low-income members facing protracted balance of payment issues (formerly known as PRGF). The loans are repayable in 10 equal semiannual installments 5\u00bd - 10 years after disbursement. \r SCF Arrangements \r \r Concessional arrangements ranging from one to two years to provide financial assistance to low-income countries that are experiencing short-term but not protracted balance of payments needs. The loans are repayable in 9 equal semiannual installments 4 - 8 years after disbursement. \r \u00a0\r \r Interest on all PRGT loans (including outright drawings under the RCF) has been waived through end-December 2012. \r Arrangement Details \r \r IMF financial arrangements are reviewed regularly to assess progress in policy reforms.

{"id":"3d91810f-8f60-4a1e-9458-6217ff786b45","content":"\u201cUndocumented: A Dominican Boy\u2019s Odyssey from a Homeless Shelter to the Ivy League,\u201d by Dan-el Padilla Peralta. Penguin Press, New York, 2015. 312 pages. $27.95. Dan-el Padilla Peralta\u2019s journey from the Dominican Republic to the United States when he was 4 years old was intended to be one leg of a round-trip. But his mother\u2019s complicated pregnancy kept the family in New York City longer than expected. By the time she was well enough to return to Santo Domingo with Dan-el, his father and new brother Yando, she reconsidered. They would stay put, she said, in part for the sake of the children\u2019s educations. People had begun to notice that Dan-el was an exceptionally bright and motivated boy. \u201cUndocumented: A Dominican Boy\u2019s Odyssey from a Homeless Shelter to the Ivy League\u201d is Peralta\u2019s memoir about being a gifted but undocumented student. He is a young scholar now, teaching the classics at Columbia. His book will speak for the many who, because of their illegal status, dare not speak for themselves. \u201cUndocumented\u201d is far from a political screed. Peralta lets his personal narrative \u2014 told with an attractive mix of youthful bravado, humor, humility and angst \u2014 illustrate the human side of the immigration issues we have yet to resolve in the United States. Peralta portrays himself as a thoughtful, fun-loving, intellectually curious student with a competitive drive. But he is made uncharacteristically cautious by circumstance. It isn\u2019t until he is a senior at Princeton that he finds the courage to tell his friends about his undocumented status. Peralta\u2019s story can be read as a chronicle of one smart student\u2019s acquisition of an education. But it plays out against the backdrop of homelessness, inhospitable shelters, poverty, fear and lack of papers. Because Peralta is so gifted, his situation can\u2019t be viewed as emblematic of the problems immigrants confront. He lived a double life, moving adroitly between prep school and public housing, between hours immersed in the Greek and Roman classics in America\u2019s most hallowed educational institutions and the private, agonizing hours spent facing the dire implications of his undocumented status. Despite his rarified experiences in academia, reality bore down and began to strangle his options, one by one. Of course he couldn\u2019t be a work-study student and get a paycheck because he had no Social Security number, nor could he leave the country for junior study abroad. If he were to take advantage of the opportunity to study at Oxford, he might not get back into the United States for 10 years. He says, in a recent interview on CSPAN, that his early memories are infiltrated by foreboding, anxiety, unease and dislocation. Page 2 of 2 - Many generous people stepped up to help Peralta, beginning with a young photographer named Jeff who spotted the young boy\u2019s intelligence and who initiated a number of strategic measures to help him gain admission to Collegiate, a lauded prep school in New York City. Peralta did his part. He worked hard as a student ultimately moving from prep school through Princeton, Oxford and Stanford. He studied and mentored over summer vacations, feeling energized by learning, steeped in gratitude and humbly indebted. According to the CSPAN interview, he is still not a fully legal resident. Peralta\u2019s story is significant and universal because he has been an exemplary member of society. He, like most immigrants, is not bent on exploiting the system. He is part of this society that he has life bonds with, and he offers his own unique contributions. As a teacher and mentor of the young, he touches many lives every day. In the Epilogue, we learn that many undocumented students contact him with questions about how to gain legal status. He knows his example is not easily transferable, but there is something about his persistence that is. And Peralta\u2019s example, however special, resonates with the kind of gumption and hopefulness that we recognize as the American spirit. Even with the support of former President Clinton and George W. Bush, among others of high esteem, Peralta has been denied a clear path to citizenship. \u201cUndocumented\u201d leads readers to wonder: What about all the other immigrants, those who do not learn Latin and memorize Whitman? New York, where Peralta lived as a child and lives now, is a beautiful example of the depth of riches derived from a diverse and lively population. Peralta\u2019s \u201cUndocumented,\u201d set primarily in New York City, brings this wealth of talent to life for those who choose to see it. From the vantage point of \u201cUndocumented,\u201d the hurdles for immigrants are daunting and depressing. Even presidents cannot make exceptions to a problem locked down and frozen by Congress\u2019s resistance to negotiate despite our citizens\u2019 demands to find fair and humane solutions. We as a people cannot seem to break free from the hatred, prejudice and absence of generosity. Yet Peralta finds wisdom and comfort in the humanities he now teaches, and whose lessons he shares in \u201cUndocumented.\u201d People like Peralta are part of the solution.

They want to be close to the event that they're attending or the activity they're wanting to participate in,\" he said.\n\nThe expansion of Docklands has relocated the demographic centre of Melbourne to the west.\n\nMr Burke said that shift was likely to accelerate with the vast bulk of future hotel room development in the Docklands end of town.\n\nHoteliers and developers have moved to exploit the trend.\n\nAt least 2246 rooms are in the development pipeline in the western end of the CBD. In contrast, only 432 are expected to be built in the east, STR Global figures show.\n\nNewer hotel stock can also attract more visitors, a factor working in the west's favour. However, it could also prove difficult for existing operators.\n\n\"It's certainly going to be a bit of a challenge,\" Mr Stickland said.

Even when she explained they weren\u2019t just ordinary baby clothes \u2013 they were designer baby clothes.\n\n\u201cI called up a shelter, and they wouldn\u2019t take them, so I asked them what they wanted. They said new undies,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother shelter she called said they needed sanitary pads, and another needed a pair of closed in work boots.\n\nIt was an eye-opener. The boots were needed as a family was homeless because the father had lost his job and couldn\u2019t afford a pair of work boots that he needed to get a job on road works.\n\n\u201cWe seem to think that what charities need is what we want to donate,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThese charities don\u2019t have a big shed at the back to house the fridge and shed waiting for our donation.\u201d\n\nWith this epiphany, Juliette was determined to help and skimmed from her grocery money, buying new undies, a new pair of boots and sanitary pads. She delivered these to the shelters.\n\n\u201cI felt so good and really connected to the community.\u201d\n\nIt also got her thinking. What if she had a website that matched what charities wanted with what people had ready to donate?\n\n\u201cI spent $500 building a website, and it absolutely failed,\u201d Juliette said.\n\nThe website was not able to remove items from the list once they were donated.\n\n\u201cEvery single person I know said it would fail.\u201d\n\nAnd Juliet was filled with rage - she was not going to give up, so she spent another $900, drew up a contract to ensure what was donated fell off the list, and had another website developed.\n\nSo began GIVIT.\n\nFor the next few weeks, Juliette spent the days glued to her computer, watching for donations that would match charity needs.\n\nThen she would get them together. It eventually came to a head.\n\n\u201cMy husband asked me if I would have the time to buy him some undies, and I said I couldn\u2019t because I was waiting for donations.\u201d\n\nWhen she asked him, why, he pointed to the two-week pile of washing \u2013 mainly his \u2013 pushed in the corner.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018This website is not automatic\u2019.\u201d\n\nThat night, he came home with a bottle of wine and an idea. The virtual warehouse was born.\n\nNow the system works where donations are kept at the donor's place until a person with need selects it. That way, there are no more situations as seen in the Black Friday fires, where 40,000 pallets of donated goods are still in storage.\n\nThese pallets take up more than 50,000 square metres and cost $8 million to store, and no one has the time to sort through.\n\nAs a result of the virtual system, and the fact needs are matched directly with donations, GIVIT now handles national disasters for the Queensland government.\n\nIn 2011, when Queensland was hit by devastating floods, GIVIT had 1.8 million hits resulting in 33,500 goods matched in three weeks.\n\n\u201cCharities can go into the virtual warehouse, and the homeless person sitting with them can choose what they need \u2013 and it is like buying it because it\u2019s their choice.\u201d\n\nBecause people have a sense of control and ownership, they are more likely to look after what has been donated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy how it works. What is essential for one person is completely different for another, so I need to have no judgement.\u201d\n\nNow GIVIT can handle up to eight disasters at one time.\n\nSo far, it has raised over $600,000 for the Ravenshoe disaster, and it is still dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Marcia, where it has made 7500 donations.\n\nNow, Juliette has just launched GIVIT Kids, a safe online platform for children to give new or pre-loved belongings.\n\n\u201cI am doing a drought campaign for the next GIVIT project,\u201d she told her inspired audience.\n\nThe story first appeared on Queensland Country Life.","title":"Giving back to good causes","media-type":"News","source":"The Ararat Advertiser","published":"2015-09-09T06:02:00Z"}

He told CNN affiliate WLOX that the discovery is like finding so-called \"black boxes\" that give insight and history in to an otherwise mysterious sea creature. \n\nEven though the animal has \"killer whale\" in its name, it is a member of the dolphin family. Pygmy killer whales also have a very strange body shape. According to National Marine Fisheries Service \"they have a small head with a rounded melon that extends in front of the mouth and there is no discernable beak.\" \n\nThe pygmy killer whales were a long way from their natural habitat of deep water in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Their numbers in the region are estimated at just over 400. They are also located in Hawaii and the Western North Atlantic Ocean. \n\nThe animals were rescued and transferred to the institute, where they arrived disoriented and unable to swim. Blood tests showed the whales were dehydrated. \n\nIn the last few days, their conditions have been improving. The larger pygmy whale is swimming on its own. But the smaller one is being treated for a possible shark bite wound. \n\nWhen first rescued, the whales were separated and the smaller one started to panic.

That's probably our philosophy on offense, too...You develop a style and rhythm, and you try to keep teams off balance by scheme and how you run certain plays, and you complement one play with the next.

( www.synapsebiomedical.com ) received word that the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has recommended suspending new enrollment of the NEALS randomized control trial (RCT) of diaphragm pacing in patients with ALS. While there was no safety concern seen in the interim analysis, the decision is based on slow recruitment and inability to meet enrollment benchmarks in the next six months. The interim data analysis also indicated a trend toward a benefit to ALS patients using the NeuRx \u00ae Diaphragm Pacing System. In fact the DSMB has recommended that the investigators continue to follow (with pacing in those patients who were implanted) all enrolled patients. In a letter on September 16 to study sites, the principal investigators stated that they plan to completely reassess all available data in 6 months and ask the DSMB to reconsider its recommendation to suspend enrollment if the data continues to indicate the lack of risk and possible benefit to patients. \n \n\"Obviously we are disappointed that enrollment in this study has been this slow, but we are still committed to continuing to study the diaphragm pacing system for ALS patients,\" said Anthony Ignagni President \/CEO of Synapse Biomedical, \"We are confident in the safety and therapeutic utility of DPS when patients are carefully selected and screened according to FDA approved criteria. We will pour our support behind the U.S. Post Approval Study (PAS). The PAS has already surpassed its initial enrollment target and interim data shows a positive benefit for ALS patients. In fact the PAS exceeds the survival results as reported in the IDE pivotal trial with 21 months survival from implant.\" \n\n\"There is a select group of patients that diaphragm pacing works in and we need to continue to do research in ALS to continue to confirm the results and optimize patient selection.\" said Dr. Raymond Onders , co-inventor of the NeuRx DPS \u00ae and Professor of Surgery, Remen Chair in Surgical Innovation, University Hospitals Cleveland Case Medical Center. . \n \nAbout \u00a0 NeuRx DPS \u00ae Technology \nNeuRx Diaphragm Pacing System \u00ae (NeuRx DPS \u00ae ) is a four-channel, battery-powered neurostimulator with implanted electrodes. The device provides electrical stimulation to the muscle and nerves of the diaphragm. The NeuRx DPS \u00ae received CE Marking (CE Registration #518356) on November 20, 2007 and is approved for treating patients with diaphragm dysfunction in the European Union. The NeuRx DPS \u00ae received FDA approval for ventilator dependency from spinal cord injury on June 17, 2008 . In Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), the NeuRx DPS \u00ae provides ventilator support in patients with diaphragm dysfunction of neuromuscular origin. Diaphragm dysfunction can result in abnormal or absent respiration in patient populations of high-level spinal cord injury and other injuries or diseases affecting the neuromuscular respiratory pathways. \n \nThe NeuRx DPS \u00ae received FDA approval for treating chronic hypoventilation from ALS on September 28, 2011 .

This is because we approach the two concepts differently. For dedicated yogis, they approach the activity as a lifelong journey to self improvement. They form a spiritual connection to the practice. When it comes to working out, many people approach it more clinically. They get hung up on seeing instant results and feel like hitting the gym or going for a run is a chore and not a part of maintaining a balanced lifestyle.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having external or aesthetic goals, but in my experience, most clients who find true, long-term success also tend to fall in love with the process itself.\u201d says Jessi Kneeland, personal trainer and fitness writer. Yoga teaches students to know their strengths and limitations. It is about doing only what your body is capable of, and not straining yourself to do a downward dog. Whereas, working out is only considered productive if you feel like a nauseous, sweaty mess afterwards. \u201cThe future of the fitness industry should be anti \u2013 fast results and anti \u2013 instant gratification.\u201d explains Jessi.

{"id":"a22f4513-3cd7-4634-a0dd-94cf00a313cc","content":"Endeavour International Corp. (USOTC:ENDRQ) \nIntraday Stock Chart  \nToday : Thursday 24 September 2015 \n  \nBERLIN\u2014Volkswagen AG has told the German government that some of its European-sold diesel passenger cars are affected by software that evaded emissions-testing standards in the U.S. \n \nAfter Volkswagen said earlier this week that the software was installed on some 11 million cars world-wide, it had long been expected that the auto maker's home market in Western Europe would also be affected. But Thursday's disclosure underscores the logistical challenges faced by Volkswagen, as well as governments, regulators, dealers and car buyers on both sides of the Atlantic, in sorting out which cars are affected and what can be done about it. \n \n\"We have been informed that there are also 1.6- and 2-liter diesel cars that are affected in Europe,\" Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told journalists in Berlin. \"We will continue to work intensively with Volkswagen to find out which vehicles are affected,\" he said. \n \nMr. Dobrindt said the ministry didn't yet have specific numbers for Europe, but that should be clarified in the \"coming days\" as the ministry continues to work closely with Volkswagen. Mr. Dobrindt said the government would wait until it had defined the scope of any damages with Volkswagen to decide on possible consequences for those cars where manipulation was detected. \n \nUnderscoring the new jitters across the global auto industry amid the Volkswagen scandal, investors also dumped shares of BMW AG early Thursday after a report by a local auto magazine that a road test of one of its diesel-powered sport-utility vehicles showed higher emissions than in laboratory testing. BMW said it wasn't familiar with the specific test but that many of its diesel models had been tested satisfactorily both on the road and in the lab. \n \nVolkswagen has disclosed that as many as 11 million cars world-wide contained software alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to have allowed Volkswagen cars to pass emissions lab tests, despite much higher emissions in real-world driving. The EPA could force Volkswagen to recall almost 500,000 U.S.-made cars because of the software. \n \nVolkswagen has apologized and said it is working to identify affected cars and fix the problem. It has set aside \u20ac6.5 billion ($7.27 billion) to deal with liability and other costs stemming from the software issue. Volkswagen on Thursday declined to comment further on the German disclosure, beyond its previous statements about the number of cars affected world-wide. \n \nWestern Europe is Volkswagen's most important market. The company's market share in the region approaches 25% for light vehicle sales, compared with less than 5% in North America. That share has been growing quickly in Europe and Asia, while stalling in North America. \n \nIt is still far from clear whether the software identified by the EPA helped cars in Europe beat emissions tests. Analysts say that because of Europe's much-looser rules on diesel emissions like nitrogen oxide, diesel engines that might fail U.S. emissions standards could still pass European Union rules. \n \nStill, it further complicates Volkswagen's challenge in sorting out which cars are affected and which ones may fall afoul of government regulations. Once that is determined, executives will face the more challenging questions of whether the cars can be fixed in a recall, or whether owners and dealers may need to be compensated in other ways. Some European governments, meanwhile, have provided subsidies for so-called clean diesel cars, and they may seek to claw back funds if Volkswagen cars weren't as clean as advertised. \n \nMr. Dobrindt said the transport ministry is also investigating vehicles of other car makers as part of the probe into the Volkswagen scandal. He didn't name companies being investigated. \n \nMeanwhile, BMW shares fell more than 8% early Thursday, after magazine Auto Bild reported one of the German car maker's model's emissions on the street were much higher than allowed in Europe under standardized testing conditions. \n \nEnvironmental groups have in the past reported on discrepancies in emissions levels between test performance and road performance, but the issue has become much more sensitive to investors and car buyers in the wake of last week's EPA accusations against Volkswagen. \n \nAuto Bild, said Thursday in a pre-release of an article to be published later this week that BMW's X3 xDrive 20d SUV, powered by a diesel engine, emitted more than 11 times more nitrogen oxide than permitted by the European Union under standardized conditions. The magazine said the results came through a street test conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research organization. \n \nBMW said Thursday it hadn't manipulated test results. \"At the BMW group, there are no specific activities or technical provisions which influence the emissions recorded during the test mode,\" said a spokesman. The company's exhaust treatment systems are active whether on the test bench or on the road, he added. \n \nBMW also said that two studies carried out by the ICCT had shown that the BMW X5 and 13 other BMW models complied with the legal requirements concerning nitrogen oxide emissions. \"We are not familiar with the test mentioned by Auto Bild concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 during a road test,\" BMW said in a statement. \"No specific details of the test have yet been provided and therefore we cannot explain these results. We will contact the ICCT and ask for clarification of the test they carried out.\" \n \nRepresentative of the ICCT weren't immediately available for comment. \n \nThe new report comes after BMW received an early reputational boost amid the Volkswagen scandal. Researchers at West Virginia University, who led some of the research that focused U.S. regulatory scrutiny on Volkswagen in the first place, compared BMW and Volkswagen diesel models in road tests in California. In those tests, emissions from a BMW X5 SUV matched or came in under what the vehicle produced in laboratory tests, the researchers said they found. But two Volkswagen models, a Jetta and a Passat, far exceeded emissions levels from lab testing. \n \nWilliam Boston and Costas Paris contributed to this article. \n \nWrite to Ruth Bender at  Ruth.Bender@wsj.com and Friedrich Geiger at  friedrich.geiger@wsj.com \n   \nAccess Investor Kit for \"BMW AG\" \n \nVisit http:\/\/www.companyspotlight.com\/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0005190003 \n \nAccess Investor Kit for \"Volkswagen AG\" \n \nVisit http:\/\/www.companyspotlight.com\/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007664039 \n \nSubscribe to WSJ: http:\/\/online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires \n   \n(END) Dow Jones Newswires \n \nSeptember 24, 2015 09:45 ET (13:45 GMT) \nCopyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.","title":"VW European Cars Affected By Emissions Evading Software","media-type":"News","source":"ADVFN India","published":"2015-09-24T14:05:21Z"}

Some might see it as just a swoopy Ford Fusion because it\u2019s built on the same platform, but it\u2019s more than that. For one thing, the MKZ comes with Lincoln Drive Control, with three modes to set the dampers, steering response, stability and traction control, and active noise cancellation. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive available. \n \nThe standard engine is the EcoBoost 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that is reasonably quick most of the time, and gets an EPA-estimated 33 Highway miles per gallon with front-wheel drive. It makes 240 horsepower and is mated to a paddle-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission. \n \nThen there is a more Lincoln-like 3.7-liter V6 making 300 horsepower that gets 26 mpg Highway. \n \nAt the other extreme there\u2019s the MKZ Hybrid that gets 40 mpg Combined, and many have topped that on test drives. It uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine combined with lithium-ion batteries that are lighter and packaged better than on previous Ford hybrids, and a CVT. \n \nThe MKZ can be equipped with inflatable rear seatbelts in addition to the latest safety technology, including adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and collision warning with braking. There\u2019s also parking assist, which takes control of the steering and parks the car for you. \n Model Lineup  \nWith the standard EcoBoost four-cylinder, the MKZ is $35,190, and the Hybrid is the same MSRP. All-wheel drive is about $2000. The cost peaks with the all-wheel-drive Black Label model, at $47,495. \n Exterior  \nGive Lincoln credit for daring design, without glitz and glamour. The MKZ has bold and curious styling. It emanates character, but might not be for everyone. It\u2019s way modern; elegant, smooth and aerodynamic from the nose to the deck lid, almost a fastback like the Audi A7. But if you look deep into the winged grille, you might see homage to the 1938 Lincoln Zephyr that started it all. \n Interior  \nDominating the cabin is an available panoramic roof that opens up 15 square feet of ceiling to the sky. But the standard luxury fittings are fairly conventional, and even spartan compared to some competition; there\u2019s a lot of real wood trim, but leather isn\u2019t standard. It has a European touch. \n \nThe transmission shifts by paddles on the steering wheel, while its main setting is by pushbuttons lining the LCD screen; there is no lever on the console, so the screen is lowered and wrapped in metallic trim, and it dominates the instrument panel. It\u2019s not bad, it suits the cohesive arrangement of the gauges, and their glow. \n \nThe screen content is another matter, especially MyFord Touch with its four displays that step on each other. Ford keeps updating the system, trying to streamline it. If, like us, you can\u2019t fathom the distracting touch method, there are steering wheel controls and voice command. But be prepared for your Lincoln to disobey your voice commands. \n Driving Impressions  \nThe 240-horsepower EcoBoost four cylinder accelerates to 60 mph in a leisurely 7.5 seconds, dragging the MKZ\u2019s weight of nearly two tons; its 270 pound-feet of torque and 6-speed automatic transmission are frequently challenged and fully used. During two-lane passing, throttle response is prompt, with nary a hint of turbo lag, so acceleration decent. However the engine can sound coarse at full throttle, overpowering the noise cancellation system that otherwise keeps noise down. \n \nThe paddle-shifting 6-speed automatic transmission is sharp, but in manual mode it\u2019s necessary to stay in a gear that keeps the revs up, or else the engine lags and acceleration fades. Some cars in this class have 7- or 8-speed transmissions, which help keep the revs up because with tighter gear spacing there\u2019s less of a drop between shifts. \n \nThe 300-horsepower V6 accelerates to 60 mph in 6.0 seconds, that\u2019s more like it. It\u2019s mated to the same transmission, controlled by the pushbuttons. It\u2019s smooth and calm, compared to the turbo four. \n \nThe Hybrid mates its 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine to lithium-ion batteries and a continuously variable transmission to get its 40 miles per gallon. It only comes in front-wheel drive, and the acceleration is tepid. You can feel more differences, including lighter steering and slower response with the CVT than the automatic; but it\u2019s smooth and quiet, and encourages satisfying efficient driving with smart and engaging displays. \n \nThanks partly to a rigid chassis, the MKZ handles well, competent and sure-footed. It changes direction quickly, especially in Sport mode, with level cornering and good grip for a car this size with all-season tread on the tires. The electric power steering is nicely weighted but a little numb; it\u2019s accurate and quick, from lock to lock just 2.7 turns. \n \nThe ride is taut, firm but not harsh in the Sport mode, where we kept it most of the time; we found the other modes too soft. In Sport mode you feel only the big bumps. \n Final Word  \nDistinctive styling, sporty handling, taut ride, and three powertrains to choose from. It\u2019s not your father\u2019s Lincoln Town Car. MyFord Touch could be a dealbreaker, so try before you buy.","title":"2016 Lincoln MKZ","media-type":"News","source":"New Car Test Drive","published":"2015-09-01T20:10:56Z"}
{"id":"9f762b30-ecfe-41ad-b194-9fe382b4f2a3","content":"MANCHESTER, England -- West Ham was the biggest early mover on the final day of trading in Britain's summer transfer window, taking midfielders Alex Song and Victor Moses on loan and buying Croatia striker Nikica Jelavic on Tuesday. Everton signed Argentine defender Ramiro Funes Mori from River Plate for 9.5 million pounds ($14.5 million) on a five-year deal. Plenty more moves are expected on what is usually a frantic day at activity among Premier League clubs. The biggest deal is likely to be Monaco forward Anthony Martial's move to Manchester United in a reported deal worth at least 36 million pounds ($55 million), which would make the 19-year-old Frenchman the most expensive teenager in the history of the game. Premier League clubs have already spent nearly 800 million pounds ($1.2 billion) in this window, which is close to breaking its record of 835 million pounds set last summer, according to football finance expert Deloitte. ''This level of spending continues to be driven in large part by the increases in domestic and overseas broadcast revenue in recent years,'' said Alex Thorpe, senior manager in Deloitte's Sports Business Group. Song will spend a second straight season on loan at West Ham from Barcelona. The Cameroon midfielder's children play in the West Ham academy. Moses will spend a third straight season away from Chelsea, with the Nigeria winger having previously had loan spells at Liverpool and Stoke. And Croatia striker Jelavic left Hull - relegated from the Premier League last season - to join West Ham on a two-year deal. Funes Mori, one of River Plate's best players in the team that won the 2014 Copa Sudamericana and 2015 Copa Libertadores, moved to Everton for 9.5 million pounds ($14.5 million) on a five-year deal to provide competition for Phil Jagielka and John Stones at center back. Funes Mori attended Everton's Premier League match against Manchester City last month, and was pictured wearing a blue-and-white Everton scarf, but had to wait more than a week before sealing his move.","title":"West Ham make triple signing on deadline day","media-type":"News","source":"FOXSports.com","published":"2015-09-01T13:16:39Z"}

{"id":"6823e9fb-db7e-4782-a05c-ba33fc6179fc","content":"The beverage industry is about giving back to the community. Producers of craft beer and spirits possess an underrated power, humbly changing water into magical elixirs that give us lushes life. But Half Acre Beer Company co-founder Gabriel Magliaro is taking the community service act to another level by giving back to a place that\u2019s partially responsible for his success. Introducing Harshad kolsch, a super-clean beer with an earthy, citrusy nose, brewed specially for the 150th anniversary of his alma mater, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The beer was released at a private event for SAIC alumni, but the curious can head to the Lincoln Square taproom (4257 N. Lincoln Ave.) for a pint on draft ($5) or a bomber ($7.99 and worth it for the label), while the beer lasts. \n\nMagliaro, 37, went to SAIC from 2001 to 2003 and worked in advertising for three years after he graduated. Before SAIC, he lived in Colorado, where he got a taste of the culture behind microbreweries, and though\u00a0he didn\u2019t see himself opening a brewery while in school, it eventually became his dream job. Half Acre got its start in 2006, brewing with Sand Creek Brewing Company in Wisconsin when there wasn\u2019t much going on in Chicago\u2019s craft beer scene. Magliaro teamed up with Matt Gallagher, and the two took off from there. Now, the pair operate two brewing facilities\u2014the original in Lincoln Square with a taproom and a new 60,000-square-foot, 30-barrel brewhouse (2050 W. Balmoral Ave.) in Bowmanville, where flagship beers such as Daisy Cutter are produced and that soon will house a restaurant and biergarten. Magliaro sat down to chat about Harshad and how an art school kid rose to running a successful business.\u00a0 \n\nTell me about the name Harshad. What does it mean? \n \nMagliaro: Harshad is a mathematical reference to the number itself, 150, but it\u2019s also a Sanskrit word that means joy seeker. [Half Acre and SAIC] thought that was very appropriate, seeing as the artistic process really centers on that\u2014whether it\u2019s on the creative\u2019s side or on the observer\u2019s side. \n\nWhat did you study at SAIC? \n\nI studied visual communication, photography and writing. The great thing about the school is you can experience a lot of different things while you're there, and it can be as narrow or as broad as you choose. \u2026 I got to experience a range of ideas that tie back to Half Acre and being an entrepreneur almost perfectly because doing what we do for a living, just being an entrepreneur and starting a business, you really have to be proficient, if not good, at a lot of different things and be able to tackle different subject matter quickly and effectively. \n\nComing from an art school, were you ever fearful about starting your own business and not having a cut-from-the-fabric business background? \n\nSure. Still am. I think that\u2019s part of the gig kind of. I think the types of insecurities change. They exist today, but different types of fears. But I did not go to business school. I did not have an MBA. Getting into this, that factual, raw tax-law mindset was not something I possessed, but I think what I did have was some guts and also the ability or confidence to think about things creatively. I could bob and weave in a way that allowed me ... to think creatively about what was happening and how to approach it, and that certainly speaks to my experience at the school. \u2026 A lot of things that you might learn in business school are out there right now in books, but at art school and SAIC, that sort of ongoing training in the process of creativity, you can\u2019t really access that in the same way. \n  \nYou take a very creative approach to your business, and I think some people are really stuck in this idea that business-minded people have to be really clean-cut and uncreative. \n \nBut the challenge is to interject your art into whatever you're doing, so you have to really be willing to define or redefine whatever your undertaking is and apply your arts education or the way you think into making your artwork. Here, it was about looking at how we approach making beer when we\u2019re doing it, our labels and how we communicate and interjecting ourselves in a way that best suits our creative self. When I was at school, I saw [Mark Bello] from Right-On Futon speak\u2014he went to the Art Institute\u2014and at the time, he had this corner store at Milwaukee and Division, and he talked about, like, \u201cI sell futons, but every month in my window I have a revolving display,\u201d and they were really good. I can remember going by them all the time. So he took it upon himself to interject that part of him in what he was doing. So you gotta get out there and apply your creativity wherever you land, and there is that outlet \n\nAny other inspirations? \n\nJust the Right-On Futon guy. [Laughs.] No, everywhere there were little bits, and I try to be a student of everything. Today we don't pretend to have this mapped out. We\u2019re very much still students of this, and it's an ongoing learning process and we'll try to evolve. We\u2019ll try to be the same type of students from \u201906 until whatever it is, we\u2019ll keep going. \n\nIt's interesting that you have such a creative background, but when you started in the craft beer scene, it wasn't necessarily super creative. \n\nNo, it was definitely the opposite at the time. It was really about regurgitating the same sales over and over with the same institution brewers. That was an initial challenge for sure, but we had a part in changing that, and also the world around us was changing. People were thinking differently about consumption in general, whether that was what they were drinking or what they were consuming from a buyer's perspective. Just the makers\u2019 movement as a whole, people were all of a sudden interested in [trying new things], and that's been an essential advantage with us being able to do what we do. \n\nMoney can be an intimidating factor for any business, and it's especially something that hinders artists who get in their heads about not having money. So were you sitting on a gold mine? \n\nOh, God no. We started brewing at another brewing company because we couldn't afford to do this, which is not uncommon. We didn't possess a lot of the things to build a brewery at the time \u2026 and we started making beer up north and bringing it back to Chicago and begging people to try it. That was pre-\u201908 market collapse. Matt and I wrote up a business plan and we pitched some banks, and they bit. They loaned us what we thought at the time was a colossal amount of money, and we knew some other brewers in Colorado, they had just built their new brewery, so we offered to buy their entire old brewery. \n  \nWhat\u2019s your advice to students on\u00a0how they can be better artists? \n \nReally think about the definition of what that is. I would say don't be afraid to completely define it and redefine it and redefine it again. It's really just about taking a creative approach to life and to really get after it. A lot of what allowed us to do this was risk and laying it out there and working a lot of hours. \u2026 The success of the early days of Half Acre was on our sweat. It\u2019s really not any more complicated than that. I think we made some good choices, but we did it at the expense of ourselves. ... And hopefully you're doing something you feel really good about. Otherwise, I can't imagine it happening any other way. If I wasn\u2019t pumped about really everything, start to finish\u2014what we were making, who I was working with, the people coming in and connecting with it\u2014if all that didn't feel right to me, we would have definitely bailed or something because it's hard enough if all of those things feel good. Definitely shoot for things that feel good, and don't be afraid to sweat a bunch. \n  \nSince Half Acre was one of the early\u00a0breweries in the Chicago craft scene, you could very easily just keep doing what you're doing and be successful, but do you find that other new breweries popping up challenge you? \n\nSure, but I'd say they uplift us too. Just doing [Harshad] is a way for us to invigorate [ourselves] and invigorate the people that are drinking our beer and connect back to the community and serve Chicago and probably will stand as an example for other breweries too. That's something you can do, connect with an educational institution that meant something to your business and highlight your path through what they do. So I\u2019d say we [challenge] other people, and we have others that [challenge] us, and it's a positive thing. \n\nFor more eat & drink news, click here . \n Copyright \u00a9 2015, RedEye","title":"From art school to brew master: Half Acre cofounder pays homage to SAIC with anniversary beer","media-type":"News","source":"Red Eye Chicago","published":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z"}

UberX drivers hauled through courts\n\nA consumer advocacy group says it has debunked the NSW Taxi Council's claims that ride-sharing services places passengers at risk, declaring leading disrupter Uber as safe and reliable.\n\nIn the wake of the state government's announcement a , the lobby rolled out an advertising campaign with the slogan: \"Ridesharing. It's no safer than hitch-hiking\".\n\nChoice scrutinised the claim. Its staff made 56 trips around Sydney - half UberX rides and half regular taxi rides - in pairs and at seven different times to capture surge pricing.\n\nIt concluded that ride-sharing service UberX, which is illegal under the NSW Passenger Transport Act, was safe, reliable and cost effective.\n\n\"When we looked at a comparative between UberX and the taxi industry on things like checks, record of trip, GPS tracking, rating system and insurance, UberX performed very well, as did the taxi industry,\" said Choice's Tom Godfrey.\n\n\"The taxi industry is running an almighty scare campaign. But what we need to do is to stand back and have a level-headed approach to any regulations required, with consumers interests firmly at the centre.\"\n\nThe NSW Taxi Council said it stood by its slogan and that Choice had compared a legal industry, with an illegal and unregulated one.\n\n\"[We] believe it is in the consumer's interest to make them aware that if they get into a private illegal ride-sharing vehicle with a private driver where there are no government-backed checks for safety and security; it is akin to hitch-hiking,\" it said.\n\nThe Australian Taxi Drivers Association, which is attempting \"to put UberX out of business\", said the fact there were no incidents or accidents in the 56 trips did not prove it was a safe service.\n\nChoice found UberX was cheaper than a taxi about nine times out of 10. It also said taxis were 40 per cent more expensive on average.\n\nOn three occasions, UberX was an average of 6 per cent more expensive because of surge pricing. Of the 28 UberX rides, Choice encountered surge pricing four times.\n\nIt found taxis showed up quicker on average, largely because they could be hailed off the street.\n\n\"However, when taxis were booked they tended to take longer to show up than UberX. There were also two times taxis didn't show up at all, pointing to the well-known issue across the industry around reliability,\" said Choice's campaigns director, Matt Levey.\n\n\"Part of the problem may be that taxi drivers are told the passenger's destination, which may make short trips less attractive. Uber drivers on the other hand aren't given your destination until they turn up.\"\n\nMichael Jools, president of the Australian Taxi Drivers Association, conceded the taxi booking process was flawed.\n\n\"The reliability of a booked service is vastly improved when a confirmation takes place between the accepting driver and the passenger,\" he said.\n\n\"The ATDA believes that such confirmation should occur with taxis, and that it is a fault of the taxi networks not to have such procedures. Fix that up,\" he said.\n\nChoice released the findings ahead of the taskforce delivering its recommendations to the Government in late October.\n\n\"The point of regulating should be to protect consumers and encourage competition in the market, not to protect one particular business from its competitors,\" said Mr Levey.

(Photo: The Enquirer\/Janelle Gelfand) \n\n\u201cIt is an exciting time of transformation at Music Hall, and SPMH is right in the middle of it,\u201d said Don Siekmann, outgoing president of the Society for the Preservation of Music Hall. \n\nWhile officials have been finalizing the big-ticket renovation of Music Hall, the hall\u2019s support group \u2013 SPMH \u2013 has continued to make improvements behind the scenes, raise money and conduct tours of the landmark building. \n\nThe society, founded by volunteers 27 years ago, held its annual meeting in Corbett Tower on Tuesday, a day after the Music Hall Revitalization Company announced a firm timeline and design team to lead extensive renovations. Members heard further details about the construction plans from Stephen Leeper, president and CEO of Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC), developer of the project. Among the revelations: The historic, now-hidden carriageways will be re-purposed as VIP and concession areas. \n\nSPMH\u2019s hand is evident everywhere you look in Music Hall \u2013 from cleaning the chandeliers to funding plumbing repairs. This past year, the society paid $15,000 to \u201cdeep clean\u201d the marble and slate lobby floor, which is original to the 1878 hall. \n\nDocent guides took a record 2,400 people on backstage tours. And this year, SPMH took ownership of the superb \u201cMighty Wurlitzer Organ,\u201d which formerly graced the long-gone Albee Theater. It was gifted to the group by the Ohio Valley Chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society. An anonymous donation of $1.4 million funded its installation in Music Hall\u2019s Ballroom, where organ concerts are presented to sell-out crowds. \n\nAlso on Tuesday, board member Kathleen Janson introduced a display of art-carved wooden panels from Music Hall\u2019s original Hook and Hastings organ. They are temporarily on exhibit in Corbett Tower. She has led the project to rescue and restore the panels \u2013 many which were lost in Music Hall\u2019s last renovation \u2013 and announced several privately-owned panels that have been donated to the effort. Their restoration is being funded by the Patricia Corbett Endowment Fund of SPMH. \n\nIt is the society\u2019s goal, she said, to display these rare pieces in Corbett Tower after Music Hall\u2019s renovation, shown as they would have been mounted on the organ screen. They are fine examples of Cincinnati\u2019s own art-carved movement. \n\nSPMH\u2019s new president, Peter E. Koenig, partner in Buechner Haffer Meyers & Koenig Co, LPA, said it is his aim to keep Music Hall in the public eye after it closes in June. \n\n\u201cI envision that while Music Hall is dark during up to18 months of construction, SPMH will continue to increase the visibility of this iconic landmark in the consciousness of our community,\u201d Koenig said. \u201cWe look forward to re-emerging with Music Hall\u2019s re-opening in the fall of 2017 with abundant tours to showcase what will be the best concert hall in America.\u201d \n\nTo join, or for information, visit spmhcincinnati.org. \n\nComposer Libby Larsen visits CCM \n\nGrammy Award-winning American composer Libby Larsen, the first woman to serve as a resident composer with a major orchestra, will return to the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music on Sept. 26 for a performance of her new work, \u201cThe Birth Project.\u201d \n\nA trio of faculty and alumni artists will perform the Cincinnati premiere in Robert J. Werner Recital Hall as part of CCM\u2019s Fall Faculty Artist Series. Larsen has written her newest song cycle for CCM associate professor of voice Gwen Coleman Detwiler and CCM graduate Audrey Luna. \n\nLydia Brown, who joined the CCM opera faculty last year, will collaborate at the piano. The piece lends a fresh perspective to childbirth, a topic rarely addressed in vocal literature. Larsen\u2019s \u201cThe Birth Project\u201d explores the emotions of childbirth, in songs set to texts by modern authors, such as Jennifer Gilmore, Langston Hughes and many others. \n\nLarsen is one of America\u2019s most prolific and most performed composers living in America today, with more than 400 works, including chamber music, orchestral works and 12 operas. \n\nDetails: 2 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 26 in Werner Recital Hall.

I had heard that the campus was the flagship of liberal academia, and I was also familiar with other bastions of liberalism during my time in the Ivy League and at Oxbridge as an undergraduate and a master\u2019s student, respectively. But despite UC Berkeley\u2019s ultra-liberal reputation, I took it as a given that there was still significant latitude for free thought and expression in the classroom. \n \nThus, I was not expecting the unapologetically heavy-handed double standard I encountered from the professor, a well-respected biblical scholar. His initial cutting remark within five minutes of the start of class was soon followed by more: \u201cThis stuff isn\u2019t taught in synagogues or churches because they don\u2019t want to piss people off. \u2026 Anyone can take this class, as long as you play by the rules of the game. \u2026 If you disagree with the approach we use, that\u2019s an F.\u201d \n \nI was shocked \u2014 not only by his contempt for religion but also by the fact that he wasn\u2019t even trying to be subtle about his narrow-minded academic approach. Apparently, free thought and academic curiosity were off limits from the get-go. \u201cI don\u2019t want people who are going to disagree with me all semester,\u201d the professor declared in no uncertain terms. \n \nTo be fair, part of me understood where my professor was likely coming from. After all, as Thomas Kuhn writes in his classic book \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\u201d prevailing paradigms within any disciplinary study (including the study of the Bible) demand adherence to certain assumptions or ground rules that allow the field to advance within that paradigm. Thus I understood that my professor probably wanted to operate within a historical-critical framework of studying the Old Testament without having to deal with students questioning the fundamental basis of that approach to literary criticism. \n \nKuhn, however, also points out that paradigms are often flawed. \n \nSo, undeterred, I politely peppered my professor with questions to try to better understand his intellectual paradigm. Just to be clear, there is a correct answer you want us to accept, I asked. \u201cCorrect.\u201d What about rigorous biblical scholarship claiming, for instance, that Moses did, in fact, write the vast majority of the Pentateuch? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d It does, I argued. \u201cI don\u2019t want people who are going to disagree with me all semester,\u201d he repeated. I thought a university was an environment in which multiple viewpoints and debates were encouraged, I countered. \u201cNot in this classroom\u201d came the maddeningly smug response. \n \nAfter the class, I was left shaking my head, a mixture of indignation, sadness, confusion and frustration exploding inside me. As I packed up my things, other students came over to me and thanked me for my questions, explaining that they, too, were upset about the professor\u2019s overly harsh attitude toward religion and religious students. We all felt the arrogance of the professor and the injustice of the situation, but did not know what to do about it. \n \nAs I have continued to process the encounter over the past year, I have realized that the attitude and ultimatum of my professor troubled me for two major reasons. \n \nFirst, I was deeply troubled by the hypocrisy of a famously \u201cliberal\u201d school employing such a closed-minded professor. In fact, the professor\u2019s actions ran directly counter to the stated diversity values of the University of California. According to the UCnet website , \u201cDiversity is a defining feature of the University of California and we embrace it as a source of strength. Our differences \u2014 of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, socioeconomic status, abilities, experience and more \u2014 enhance our ability to achieve the university\u2019s core missions of public service, teaching and research. We welcome faculty, staff and students from all backgrounds and want everyone at UC to feel respected and valued.\u201d Not only did the professor make no effort to value students with academic and religious perspectives differing from his own, but he actively persecuted us, essentially forcing us to drop his class or suffer. \n \nSecond, the fact that religious persecution was flaunted so unabashedly by a well-established professor in front of an entire classroom of students \u2014 at the premier public university in the world, no less \u2014 speaks to a teaching culture that, at best, tacitly acquiesces to his attitude and, at worst, actively encourages it. This was certainly not the first class this professor has taught, nor is he the only professor to openly criticize religion in a UC Berkeley classroom, nor is UC Berkeley the only campus where this type of persecution is a problem. A number of my friends, at UC Berkeley and other universities, have experienced similarly hypocritical discrimination based on their unpopular religious or scholarly perspectives, thanks to a certain \u201cliberal\u201d fundamentalism as narrow-minded as any conservative, religious fundamentalist. Such a deep-seated posture of indifference toward the religious and academic freedom of students \u2014 in general, but particularly for those of strong religious faith, who are often the minority \u2014 is shameful and outrageous. Everyone deserves a seat at the table. \n \nAs Kuhn points out, recourse to criteria outside existing paradigms is essential when two schools of thought are in competition with each other. After all, what better place to explore the intricacies and nuances of competing academic paradigms than the modern university? The permission to explore, think and argue is invaluable in both advancing scholarship and protecting religious freedom. As such, the \u201cliberal\u201d double standard \u2014 by which all views and scholarship is permissible and encouraged, except those deemed too traditional, passe or otherwise unpalatable for the sophisticated 21st century thinker \u2014 is simply unacceptable at the modern pluralistic university. \n\nDavid Kurz is a second year doctoral student at UC Berkeley.","title":"Hypocrisy of UC Berkeley liberalism is unacceptable","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Californian","published":"2015-09-08T14:06:47Z"}
{"id":"6ce39d04-05e4-433f-b833-4cffc94bdc13","content":"Matching our deserts is such a fun way to enter into any party! In this second edition of our Cake & Cuts matching party series we are pairing miniature victory roll cakes (aka cinnamon rolls) with a victory roll hair style reminiscent of the 1940\u2019s jubilee for\u00a0classically fun\u00a0fall style. Be the Betty of the brunch table with this simple match\u00a0that boosts of golden hues and supreme style victory. First let\u2019s start with the victory cinnamon rolls. These tasty little treats are one of my favorite sweets. I love cinnamon rolls because they are an acceptable form of birthday cake to eat everyday. Even for breakfast! A miniature version flecked with gold is a fabulous way to present sweets at any birthday, anniversary, shower, bakesale, or even a busy Monday morning. Victory Cinnamon Rolls To make these miniature victory rolls you will need: For the dough: 1 package (2-1\/4 tsp) active dry yeast, 3\/4 cup whole milk, warmed, 1\/4 cup granulated sugar, 4 large eggs, 4-1\/2 cups flour, plus more as needed, 1-1\/2 tsp kosher salt, 6 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into chunks. For the caramel: 6 tbsp butter, melted, 1 cup firmly pack light brown sugar, 3 tbsp dark honey, pinch of salt, 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans. For the filling: 4 tbsp butter, at room temperature, 1\/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon. For the cream cheese icing: 2-1\/2 oz cream cheese, softened, 3 tbsp milk, 1-1\/2 cups powdered sugar, more if needed. Plus edible gold flakes. 1. Start by making the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk and let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the granulated sugar, eggs, flour, and salt. Attach the dough hook and knead on low speed, adding a little more flour if needed, until all your ingredients come together. 2. Toss in the butter and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and springy, about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl. 3. Form the dough into a ball, put it in the bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it is doubled in size, 1-1\/2 to 2 hours. 4. While the dough is rising butter the pans, using a cupcake pan will give you a perfect mini cinnamon roll. 5. Make the caramel by stirring together the melted butter, brown sugar, honey, salt, and pecans. Divide and spread the mixture in each pan.\n6. Punch down the dough and dump onto a floured work surface. Cut the dough in half. Roll out each half into a rectangle about 10 by 15 inches. Position the rectangles vertically. 7. Fill the dough. Spread each rectangle with 2 tablespoons of the room temperature butter, then half of the brown sugar and half of the cinnamon. Take a pizza cutter or sharp knife and cut about 8 strips from each rectangle. 8. To make the center of each \u201cvictory roll\u201d take one strip and starting at the end closest to you, loosely roll up the strip. Place the roll in the center of the pan. Coil two other strips around the center roll by joining the strip to the end of the previous one, until the cupcake pan is filled. 9. Cover the pans loosely with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm, draft-free spot until puffy, about 1 hour. 10. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake until the victory rolls are golden brown, 12-18 minutes (watch for doneness sooner). 11. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 12. While cakes are cooling, make the icing by whisking the cream cheese in a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar and whisk until smooth. Drizzle cream cheese icing over the top of each of the victory rolls adding small pieces of gold foil with tweezers as you go. Serve on golden plates and enjoy! Victory Roll Hair To make the matching victory roll hairstyle start with a clean head of wavy hair. 1. Take a 2 inch section from one side of the head (the best way to find a starting spot for this section is by lining it up with the outside eyebrow line). Back comb the section to add dramatic height to the hair. Spray 2. Take a smoothing comb and gently pull the section over the top front of the head smooth out the top while keeping the height underneath. 3. Use a curling iron to get a wide thick curl right at the end of this section and use a couple Bobbie pins to hold the curl into shape. Pair this fresh party look with pink lipstick for a nod to the perfect 40\u2019s hostess in a completely modern way. Grab your sweet rolls and make a serious statement at brunch this week.

They will also have a mobile security team that will be particularly focused on monitoring the crowd for any racist behaviour. \n\nGoodes is set play at Domain Stadium for the first time since he was booed vociferously in the round 17 clash between the Swans and West Coast. \n\nTwo fans were ejected from Domain Stadium during the match for two separate incidents of racial vilification. \n\nThe dual Brownlow medallist took a leave of absence following that game and missed the Swans' round 18 clash with Adelaide at the SCG. \n\nLyon coached Goodes when he was an assistant at the Swans in their 2005 premiership season. He made a strong public statement in support of Goodes following the round 17 incident. \n\nLyon said on Monday that there was no need to reiterate those comments as he felt Fremantle fans were aware of the consequences of booing Goodes. \n\n\"I don't have to reinvent any messages,\" Lyon said. \n\n\"I don't have to request anyone not to boo. I think it's clearly inappropriate to do it in the context of the past so if you choose to do that you are putting yourself at risk in terms of how you're viewed. \n\n\"There is no place for any form of racism or prejudice against anyone in AFL. \n\n\"It's not something we expect, it's not something we condone and I think everyone is really focused on football. \n\n\"If it becomes anything other than that, I'd be disappointed. But we'll focus on football and I'm sure Adam wants that. \n\n\"We won't be rolling out the red carpet for anyone. The Bloods will be the opposition, they're playing the purple and we're all going for a great spectacle of great AFL football. \n\n\"I just encourage everyone to make that be their motivation to attend the game.\"","title":"Freo fans know not to boo Goodes, says Lyon","media-type":"News","source":"Australian Football League","published":"2015-09-07T10:02:25Z"}

One of them even puts us in the Guinness Book of World Records. \n \nFor a complete list of eats, drinks, and coffees in and around downtown, make sure to bookmark the DT Eats page . Try something new! \n \nFirst, here\u2019s a flier for a new pop up sandwich shop, Linus and Pepper\u2019s, that will be open for three weeks on Salisbury Street starting today. It\u2019ll be student run and is backed by Jon Seelbinder ( Level Up Kitchen and Barcadium , The Architect ) who also is working on other projects in downtown. Read more about it in the N&O . \n \n\n  Pictured above is the rooftop seating at the new location for Taverna Agora . The restaurant moved from North Raleigh to 326 Hillsborough Street and that empty, shell of a building is now more lively than ever.  Ashley Christensen\u2019s Death and Taxes has finally opened at the corner of Salisbury and Hargett Streets.  Christensen has also announced that she is working on a pizza restaurant that will be located next door to Poole\u2019s Diner .  Now that the Charter Square south tower is complete , we\u2019re waiting to see what Eschelon Experiences brings to one of the ground-floor spaces in the building.  Construction fencing is up where Whiskey Kitchen will go at the corner of McDowell and Martin Streets.  Near Person Street, Standard Foods may actually open. At least that\u2019s what they say as they are now hiring.  Person Street Pharmacy has finished their makeover with a new cafe.   \n\n  \nPhoto of the back patio at the Raleigh Beer Garden a few days before opening. \n   In Glenwood South, Niall Hanley and Cliff Bleszinski have set a Guinness World Record for most beer taps. The Raleigh Beer Garden is now open and has 366 beer taps spread across two floors. The place is huge and should be quite a draw within and outside the city.  In 510 Glenwood, Big Boom is now open. The new restaurant is from Vincent Barresi, of Vincent\u2019s Italian Cuisine fame in North Raleigh.  JMR Kitchens ( Taste , The Oak ) is opening up more. on West Street in the former Mantra location. The new restaurant will serve \u201cItalian-inspired small plates.\u201d  Near Moore Square, Treat is now open and serves Maple View Farm ice cream.

My spirit and energy are feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, reenergized and raring to go. \n \nIt was a special time up in the Rockies. We had approximately 70 fit pros from the TD Mastermind up in the mountains for our annual Fall Retreat. Besides these guys and gals coming from all over the country, we had one fit pro in from Australia (Scott Rawcliffe), one from Kuwait (Omar AlHamad), and one couple from north of the border (Duncan & Jenn Waller, Vancouver, CA).\u00a0 The rest of the folks were from all over the country. \n \nWhile I have the opportunity to work with these great folks and the rest of their Mastermind teammates on a regular basis (on-line\/virtually), there is NOTHING like a live meeting when we are all together. LIVE connect time is always BEST. \n \nThe theme of our retreat this Fall was \u201c DREAM the imPOSSIBLE .\u201d \u00a0I challenged the Mastermind attendees to dream big. And to put pen to paper as I facilitated some deep personal development & business exercises over 2-days. It went deep. \n \nI also shared my dreams. I shared my BHAG\u2019s (big hairy audacious goals). I shared my best practices. And I shared what is most moving my soul today. \n \nAnd I encouraged them to do the same. We had time to write.To journal. To listen. To be inspired. \n \nAnd we took time to work-out. To swim. To hike. To get massages. And go in the hot tub. \n \nAnd we had time to DREAM. \n \n\n \nThis week, the WOW is DREAM. \n \nYou don\u2019t need to go to a world-class resort like the Westin Riverfront Spa & Resort to DREAM (although it doesn\u2019t hurt! \u00a0). \n \nYou can dream by: \n  Taking 10-20 minutes in the AM to journal and write down your DREAMS.  Getting out and going for a walk or run and listening to an inspirational podcast.  Visiting your local beach, nature-trail, mountain, or park and getting an outdoor workout.  Writing down your BIG 5 for Life & your BIG 5 for the Year . Your BIG 5 for Life ware the 5 things you want to achieve in your life. Your BIG 5 for the Year are the 5 things you want to achieve in the next year.   \nLastly, never underestimate the power of 2 more things: \n \n1.\u00a0 Immersing yourself in a magical environment . When you put yourself in a \u201cworld-class\u201d environment, it affects your mindset. You think world-class, you are exposed to world-class, and you THINK world-class. This can be at a resort, destination spot, or even a gym (like Fitness Quest 10 \u00a0). But seriously, this environment can be anywhere. It can be your home, your garden, or somewhere \u201csimple\u201d that stirs your spirit and moves your soul. \n \n2.\u00a0 Surround yourself with \u201cworld-class\u201d people. The folks in the Mastermind are world-class people. When I\u2019m at Fitness Quest 10, the people are world-class, both teammates and clients. IT MATTERS! Who you put yourself around matters. Who your kids hang out with matters. Who YOU hang-out with matters. So spend more time with people thatbring out the BEST in you. And that support your dreams and visions. \n \nMy friends, DREAM this week. Eat well. Train hard. Surround yourself with people that inspire you. Listen or read messages that inspireyou.

{"id":"0dd8944c-391a-4618-8481-1a5b34786a29","content":"(CNN) \u2013 He\u2019s the pinup boy of international rugby \u2014 a chiseled, highly-paid Adonis who has scored more points than any other player. \n\nBut when it comes to career-defining moments, Dan Carter\u2019s odyssey on the biggest stage has been one of sporting tragedy \u2014 the gods have not smiled kindly on his journey from small-town New Zealand to global superstar. \n\nOne of rugby\u2019s most gifted individuals, his World Cup experiences have so far been a bitter mixture of heartbreaking injury and disappointment. \n\n\u201cThis is my fourth World Cup and I haven\u2019t had a lot of success at each of them,\u201d Carter told CNN\u2019s Human to Hero series in typically understated style ahead of the All Blacks\u2019 bid to become the first team to retain the title. \n\nLike Sisyphus, condemned to endlessly push a boulder uphill before starting over again, Carter has faced constant trials and tribulations during the tournament\u2019s four-year cycles. \n\nIn 2003, the season of his international debut, he was an unused replacement as New Zealand lost in the semifinals against big rival Australia in Sydney, then broke his leg playing the Wallabies two years later. \n\nIn 2007, Carter was a key member of another All Blacks team heavily favored to triumph, but he went off injured during a crushing quarterfinal defeat by host France which triggered much angst in the rugby-mad nation. \n\nIn 2011, when New Zealand ended a 24-year wait and won the tournament on home soil, a disconsolate Carter watched from the sidelines on crutches after being ruled out due to a freak groin injury while practicing ahead of a group-stage match. \n\nHe was able to lift the coveted Webb Ellis Cup as his teammates celebrated, but behind the brave face lay another reality. \n\n\u201cThat World Cup was really tough for me,\u201d the 33-year-old says. \u201cAs a team we performed extremely well and to win it was really exceptional, but on a personal level to be knocked out just before the playoff stages with such a serious injury was really tough to take. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a few injuries throughout my career but that was probably my toughest one, and I was forever asking the whys. Why me? Why now? \n\n\u201cI needed to remain really positive, not only for me to be able to bounce back from such a serious injury like that but also for the team as well. I wanted to help out the guys who moved into my position, and sobbing around the team wasn\u2019t going to help anyone.\u201d \n\nUnlike Sisyphus, who was punished by the Greek gods for his deceitful and self-important ways, Carter is one of rugby\u2019s genuine nice guys. \n\nFor all the individual plaudits he receives, for all the endorsement deals that put his picture up on billboards around the world \u2014 often dressed in just underwear \u2014 he is at heart a dedicated team man. \n\n\u201cOne of his greatest qualities is that the team always comes first,\u201d New Zealand captain Richie McCaw told CNN. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been one of the best players in the world for a long time but it\u2019s still the All Blacks and the team performing that\u2019s more important than him. He\u2019s always just one of the boys who wants to see the team do well, which is a pretty special trait.\u201d \n\nAfter McCaw famously played with a broken foot to help New Zealand beat France in the 2011 final, Carter focused on rehab as he banished thoughts of ending his international career and signing with an overseas club \u2014 having already had a brief, lucrative stint with Perpignan during a six-month sabbatical which was predictably cut short by injury \u2014 this time a ruptured Achilles tendon. \n\nIn 2012, he was named IRB world player of the year for the second time, and in 2013 he became just the fifth New Zealander to play 100 Test matches \u2014 though he had to leave the field after less than half an hour of that milestone game against England at Twickenham. \n\nInjuries continue to haunt him. Carter broke his leg in last year\u2019s Super Rugby final, playing for the Crusaders franchise in the southern hemisphere competition. \n\nAnother setback in February sparked doubts he would feature at another World Cup, but a commanding performance in his final international on home soil against Australia last month sealed his place in the squad traveling to England. \n\n\u201cI really wanted to finish on a high and the fact that it was a do-or-die game playing for the Bledisloe Cup \u2014 which means so much to this team \u2014 was huge, there was a lot riding on that game,\u201d Carter says. \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after the final whistle when I had all this joy, and I just loved this feeling of standing out on Eden Park with my teammates feeling so happy, and then I realized this was going to be the last time that I get to experience this feeling in New Zealand. It was quite sad, I didn\u2019t want that feeling to end.\u201d \n\nRegularly listed among sport\u2019s sexiest athletes, Carter now has a young family to look after \u2014 in late 2011 he married his longtime girlfriend, former New Zealand hockey player Honor Dillon, and this year their second boy was born. \n\n\u201cI probably only see them about 50% of the year, which can be really challenging,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time you realize it\u2019s such a small window being a professional rugby player in terms of your lifetime, so you want to make the most of the opportunity and live each day like it\u2019s your last. When you do spend time with your family, you just make the most of it.\u201d \n\nAfter this World Cup, Carter will join French club Racing Metro, having agreed a three-year deal worth a reported $1.6 million each season that will make him rugby\u2019s highest-paid player. \n\nIt\u2019s a long way from his formative days in the tiny South Island town of Southbridge \u2014 population less than 800 \u2014 where he spent endless hours kicking a ball over goalposts his dad built for him in the family\u2019s front garden. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where it all started \u2014 that\u2019s probably the best birthday present I ever received,\u201d recalls Carter, who as a child was inspired by the New Zealand team that won the inaugural World Cup at home in 1987. \n\n\u201cIt was always a dream to play for the All Blacks but I never really thought it would happen, so I was out there just having fun, just throwing the ball around, kicking the ball around with my mates, by myself, with whoever I could find. I think that gave me the skill set and the base to be at the level I am playing at today.\u201d \n\nMcCaw, who first played with Carter in Canterbury\u2019s provincial team in 2002, said his friend has never lost that approach to training. \n\n\u201cI think people perhaps watch him on TV and think this is a great player, but they don\u2019t see how much hard work he puts in. He practices harder than anyone I know and he\u2019s always the last one to leave \u2014 extra kicking, extra things that make him the man he is,\u201d McCaw says. \n\n\u201cHe can do it all \u2014 ball in hand, he can tackle, he can kick, so as a fly-half he\u2019s got all the skills to be a threat wherever and he\u2019s a great man to have in your team.\u201d \n\nFor Carter it\u2019s all about being part of a team, on and off the field. \n\n\u201cRugby is something that builds friendships. I don\u2019t think I could compete in an individual sport,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cThe beauty of rugby is as soon as that final whistle has gone, your enemies are also your friends as well, and I love that camaraderie about the game. \n\n\u201cMy friendships, my best mates, are all because of rugby. Whether teammates or opponents, they are friends for life.\u201d \n\nCarter\u2019s role in the No. 10 jersey means he is the team\u2019s playmaker, directing tactics once the forward pack controls possession. \n\n\u201cMy role within the team has changed over the years. My first few years I was a young, pretty quiet guy,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cNow I am very vocal when I am out on the field, I am demanding of other players. I also have to be a good listener because the guys are often telling me what they are seeing, and I have to take that information in to make sure I\u2019m making the right decision. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my 13th year in the side so I\u2019m one of the older guys and so I need to be working really hard with the younger guys and get them up to speed, but be a real leader.\u201d \n\nCarter needed all his experience in the All Blacks\u2019 opening match of the 2015 World Cup, as New Zealand came from behind to beat Argentina 26-16 in front of a record rugby crowd of almost 90,000 at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium on Sunday. \n\nHe kicked 16 points to extend his record tally to 1,532 in his 107th international appearance, putting him 286 clear of nearest rival Jonny Wilkinson, whose final Test was in 2011. \n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s more about the bigger picture of doing whatever I can to help this team go all the way \u2014 I am just a small cog in this side,\u201d says Carter, who will sit out Thursday\u2019s second Pool C match against Namibia at London\u2019s Olympic Park as coach Steve Hansen makes 12 changes. \n\n\u201cTo be there at the end of the tournament and be lifting that Rugby World Cup up would be a dream come true. We are wanting to create history, do things that other teams have never done before and just have this mindset of being the most dominant team in the history of world rugby.\u201d \n\nIf Carter can finally land rugby\u2019s holy grail in the final on October 31, there will be few denying that he\u2019s earned it. The sporting gods, no doubt, are keeping a close eye on his progress.","title":"Dan Carter: All Blacks star seeks holy grail at Rugby World Cup","media-type":"News","source":"949 KCMO","published":"2015-09-23T11:32:48Z"}

Liberal senator Zed Seselja is \"very disappointed\" the leader he loyally served, Tony Abbott, was toppled by Malcolm Turnbull on Monday night and says the party should not forget its conservative supporters across the nation.\n\nThe ACT's only Liberal senator said he would \"back Tony Abbott 100 per cent\" going into the leadership challenge and on Tuesday was dealing with the setback of Mr Abbott's ousting and the prospect of the Liberal Party facing division.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed,\" Mr Seselja said.\n\n\"It's critically important that the Liberal Party continues to strongly represent conservative Australians.\"\n\nSenator Seselja had previously told media . At the time, he said those moving the spill motion did not represent a majority of Liberal MPs and senators.\n\nBut Liberal member for Eden-Monaro Peter Hendy supported the leadership change, voting for Mr Turnbull on Monday night.\n\n\"I thought the timing was an issue obviously, and there was a view taken by Malcolm and Julie Bishop that rather than see a very, very bad result in the Canning byelection... the time to act was yesterday and that's what happened,\" he said on ABC radio on Tuesday morning.\n\nMr Hendy said accusations that the Liberal's party right voted against Mr Turnbull were inaccurate, describing the right as \"splintered\" and Mr Turnbull's winning margin as \"very big\".\n\nIf Mr Hendy's bellwether seat was an indicator of political opinion across Australia, the tide was turning against Mr Abbott, he said.\n\n\"I was getting a lot of commentary from my constituents that the government needed to strengthen the strategy, particularly on the economy and particularly on explaining it to them and to Australians what we were doing,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Malcolm Turnbull, with his pre-parliamentary career, his time as a cabinet minister for many years, will strongly, strongly improve on that ability of the government.\"\n\nBut Labor MP Andrew Leigh said Australia \"can't move beyond the current national paralysis\" while the Liberal Party remained in power.\n\n\"Malcolm Turnbull has said he supports 'every element' in the Liberals' two unfair budgets,\" Dr Leigh said.\n\n\"He has promised there will be no change to their ineffective climate policies, and no progress on critical social issues like marriage equality.\n\n\"So it makes no difference whether it's Tony Abbott or Malcolm Turnbull who leads the Liberals \u2013 it's their entire party that is holding Australia back.\"\n\nDr Leigh swept aside suggestions Mr Turnbull's leadership would threaten Labor in the lead-up to the federal election while speaking on ABC radio Tuesday morning.\n\n\"If we can have a more sensible conversation about the future then I think that's terrific,\" he said.\n\n\"We're up for a policy-focused conversation. The question is whether Malcolm Turnbull is willing or able to move beyond the bad polices that have brought the Liberal Party to this point.\"\n\nDr Leigh acknowledged Mr Turnbull was a good speaker but said he wouldn't tie himself to unreliable, \"horse race\" opinion polls.\n\n\"Malcolm Turnbull is a good speaker; I've said to him that he should have the permanent role as parliamentary eulogist,\" he said.\n\nACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said Mr Turnbull's ascendancy should herald in a time for \"serious progress on a number of key areas that impact upon Canberrans and the broader Australian public\".\n\n\"Primarily the Commonwealth's funding cuts to hospitals and schools,\" Mr Barr said.\n\n\"This was a broken promise by the Coalition that will have significant ramifications in the years to come.\n\n\"I hope Mr Turnbull will be willing to work closely with the state and territory leaders on reversing these decisions to ensure that all Australians continue to have access to quality public health and education.\n\n\"I would encourage Mr Turnbull to prioritise progress on reform of the Federation and a serious discussion on taxation reform.\n\n\"It's also crucial that the government tackles marriage equality and climate change \u2013 two areas in which Tony Abbott failed to take significant action in line with community expectations.\n\n\"The rollout of the National Broadband Network should also be a priority for a Turnbull government, especially to areas of Canberra that are experiencing poor internet service.\"\n\nACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr congratulated Mr Turnbull agreeing it was \"a very exciting time in Australia\".\n\n\"Our country needs strong leadership from the federal government, and I hope Mr Turnbull will bring this leadership and face some of the economic challenges the nation is experiencing,\" Mr Barr said.\n\nMr Barr said Mr Abbott's downfall was another example of the brutality of modern politics.

{"id":"19b01455-3c9e-4f95-9225-d270df982054","content":"The Employee of the Month for September for the Liberty County Sheriff\u2019s Office is 15-year veteran employee, Bonnie Bishop, who is the commissary clerk for the jail division of the sheriff\u2019s office. \n  \nSheriff Bobby Rader\u2019s selection committee for this monthly honor found the selection process rather easy to select Bishop for this designation as she is highly praised by her supervisors for her work ethics as well as her vast knowledge of the workings of the agency itself. \n \n\u201cThere are many positions within any organization that work behind the scenes in order for the entire organization to function at a high level of proficiency. Bonnie heads up one of those type positions that is probably little known to the general public and often times, receives little recognition for the day to day operations that the sheriff\u2019s office is obligated to fulfill,\u201d said Capt. Ken DeFoor, LCSO spokesperson, in a written statement. \u201cHowever, to those people immediately effected by Bonnie\u2019s office and the functions that she is charged with overseeing, it is abundantly clear to those individuals just how important the commissary clerk\u2019s office is to them.\u201d \n \nThe commissary clerk\u2019s primary responsibility is to account for the monies that inmates have on them when they are brought into the jail facility as well as money orders that may be sent in by family members for commissary items for their friends or family members who are in the county jail. \n \n\u201cThen when these inmates are released, it\u2019s Bonnie\u2019s responsibility to issue checks for any funds these people may have coming to them. She also handles the phone cards, which allows inmates to communicate with friends or family members outside the facility,\u201d he said. \u201cNeedless to say, this accounting must be exact and with proper documentation of all monies accounted for while the inmate is in detention as well as upon their release. This is, by no means, a small task and Bonnie excels at this assignment.\u201d \n \nBishop was born in Duarte, Calif., and when she was 6 years old, her family moved to Humble, Texas, where she eventually graduated from high school and moved to Liberty County at the young age of 17. As time moved on, she accepted a job with the U.S. Postal service, but due to other work she had been doing with the elderly and persons with health issues, she wanted something more where she felt she could be of benefit to the community at large. \n \nWhen an opportunity presented itself to join the Liberty County Sheriff\u2019s Office as a dispatcher, this seemed to be the position that she had been seeking. So, in June, 2000, Bonnie became a dispatcher and has worked for four sheriffs thus far. She has chalked up well over 600 hours of dispatching and communications schooling. She says her first love is \u201cwatching out for our deputies on the streets.\u201d \n \nWhen asked what her most memorable calls were when she worked both as a dispatcher supervisor and handling calls herself, Bishop immediately becomes emotional when she recalls that she took a 911 call that night, in 2002, when a Liberty County deputy was killed in a patrol car wreck while en route to a call. This was not only just a sheriff\u2019s deputy, but a close friend as well. \n \nOne other call that stands out in her memory is a 911 call from a 14 year old boy who pleaded for help because he knew when his parents got home that he would be beaten with a 1\u201d X 4\u201d board. Bishop was on the telephone listening to the beating as a patrol deputy was en route to the scene. \n \nShe was later able to meet the young man who, tearfully, thanked her for saving him from further beatings and physical abuse from his parents. The commissary clerk\u2019s position is a great deal less stressful, as Bishop is quick to point out, but her first love still remains with dispatching and watching out for the sheriff\u2019s deputies. \n \nBishop is married to Corporal Hugh Bishop, also a longtime veteran with the sheriff\u2019s office, and says that her two young children take up about 90 percent of her off duty time. But it still leaves a little time for her favorite past time of watching sports on television as well as NASCAR races and such. This honor of receiving \u201cEmployee Of The Month\u201d was also a special gift as it happened to be the 12th wedding anniversary for the Bishops. \n \nBishop said she was shocked at being selected as September\u2019s \u201cEmployee Of The Month\u201d but it was a very pleasant surprise and an honor that she will cherish for many years. She wants to thank everyone that had anything to do with her selection.","title":"Bishop named LCSO employee of month for September","media-type":"News","source":"Dayton News","published":"2015-09-07T05:13:00Z"}

{"id":"1489fb6f-ff0c-4e85-9848-25150d7ec25f","content":"Robbie Tolan (Courtesy of Houston Forward Times) \n \nby Jeffrey L. Boney \nSpecial to the NNPA from the Houston Forward Times \n \n\u201c\u2026The justice that we seek will not come from these courts, it will come from us.\u201d \u2013 Marian Tolan \n \nThe fight for justice has come to a close for police brutality victim and former baseball star Robbie Tolan \u2013 at least in the courtroom. \n \nEarly Tuesday morning, attorneys for both Robbie and Bellaire police officer Jeffrey Cotton announced that a settlement had been reached between the two parties in the civil trial that was scheduled to begin that day. \n \nAccording to the settlement, the City of Bellaire will only pay $110,000 to settle the civil rights suit filed by Robbie Tolan. In addition to that, the settlement allows Robbie to discuss the details of his experience with impunity. \n \n\u201cLet me be clear about this, this is a win ONLY in the sense that I will not allow anyone else to write the end of my story,\u201d said Robbie. \u201cI will define my legacy. I will tell my story. No one will tell it for me! God has given me peace! I thank God for my parents, my extended family and friends, my awesome attorneys who were ready for battle, and all of my supporters. We are relieved to put this behind us and move on!\u201d \n \nThe journey towards this settlement has been full of many challenges and roadblocks along the way for Robbie and his family. \n \n\u201cGod understands the direction we\u2019re having to go and He understands that this has been a long and lonely journey that\u2019s lasted 7 years. I\u2019m taking the end of my story out of the judge\u2019s hands,\u201d said Robbie. \u201cMy foundation, my book, and the lives of young men and women of color who have suffered injustices will be my focus. I\u2019m ready to write the next chapter.\u201d \n \nRobbie was shot on New Year\u2019s Eve in his driveway in 2008 by Cotton, after he and Officer John Edwards mistakenly identified Robbie\u2019s vehicle as having been stolen. Robbie\u2019s vehicle was found to have not been stolen, nor was either man found to have been armed. More importantly, the license plate number that the officers entered into their computer was the wrong one, leading them to identify the wrong suspects. A grand jury indicted and acquitted Cotton, after only charging him with aggravated assault, which is what led the Tolan family to file the civil lawsuit, which eventually ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court because of the decisions by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to grant qualified immunity to the officers. The U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the civil lawsuit filed by Robbie, with a unanimous decision back in May 2014. \n \nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court said that the courts must review excessive force claims in \u201cthe light most favorable to the party asserting the injury\u201d and determine whether the right in question was \u201cclearly established at the time of the violation.\u201d In addition to that, the Supreme Court justices declared that they reached the \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d that the Fifth Circuit of Appeals made a gross error by giving more credence to the narrative presented by Cotton and his attorney\u2019s and by not delving deeper to properly investigate contradictory evidence. \n \nOnce the case landed back in the hands of Judge Harmon, things appeared to get even more challenging for Robbie and his high-powered legal team. \n \nOn Sunday, Robbie and his attorneys called for Judge Harmon to recuse herself from the case because of \u201cseeming bias and prejudice\u201d based on comments she made during a pretrial hearing last Friday. Tolan\u2019s legal team filed an emergency motion and affidavit, on his behalf, asking Judge Harmon to recuse herself from the case, citing in documents that the comments at the pretrial hearing \u201cdisclose that the judge can no longer be an impartial arbiter of this case.\u201d The affidavit filed by Robbie also alleged that Judge Harmon\u2019s comments would taint the federal jury pool and hamper his ability to receive a fair trial. In response to their request, Judge Harmon denied the recusal reconsideration motion on Monday. \n \nIn her order, Judge Harmon stated that she \u201chas never expressed a personal bias or prejudice against Robert R. Tolan or in favor of Jeffrey Cotton.\u201d She went on to say in her order that, based on case law: \u201cWhen a judge makes a ruling or says or does something in the course of pretrial or trial proceedings, impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned simply because one side wins and the other loses.\u201d \n \nIn what was a stunning blow to Robbie and his attorneys \u2013 that essentially forced them to the settlement table \u2013 Judge Harmon denied every single expert witness submitted by the Tolan legal team who were being called to testify on behalf of Tolan, while allowing the City of Bellaire to allow all of the witnesses they submitted to the court to testify. Judge Harmon then released an 18-page order preventing Tolan\u2019s legal team from presenting former Major League Baseball players, sports agents, excessive force specialists and others from testifying as expert witnesses. \n \nSome of the expert witnesses that the Tolan legal team submitted to testify included former MLB professionals such as Ken Griffey Jr. and Ken Griffey Sr. \n \nTolan\u2019s attorneys and the Tolan family began to have settlement discussions, which led to a settlement eventually being reached. \n \nOfficer Cotton was made to testify, under oath in court, that he had no assets to settle the lawsuit, which put the burden on the City of Bellaire to pay the settlement amount to Tolan. According to the Tolan legal team, the attorneys presented their accord to Judge Harmon on Tuesday morning, the day the trial was to begin, where they demanded that the City of Bellaire draw up the settlement documents in court. Furthermore, Tolan\u2019s attorneys demanded the written agreement be fleshed out in court and fully agreed upon before it was signed and this ordeal was laid to rest. For the Tolan family, it is closure concerning this case, but not concerning the continuous injustice in this country \u2013 an injustice they will continue to fight. \n \n\u201cWe did not get justice here,\u201d said Marian Tolan, Robbie\u2019s mother. \u201cThe first time the judge dismissed our case, we had to pay Officer Cotton\u2019s court fees. That was another injustice. I\u2019ve had to watch his dreams and part of his spirit die. We gave up so much as a family for a chance at justice, a chance at peace.\u201d \n \nMarian said that she believes God kept her son on this earth for a reason and insists that they are going to continue to work hard for changes in the justice system. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up,\u201d said Marian. \u201cThere are some things that need to be changed and we\u2019re going to work toward that change. The justice that we seek will not come from these courts, it will come from us.\u201d \n \nAttorney Benjamin Crump said that he and Robbie will begin to aggressively push for police body cameras on a national scale. They are both scheduled to appear on several panels at this week\u2019s Annual Legislative Conference (ALC), hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington D.C., where they will address police brutality and the need for body cameras. \n \n\u201cAs an attorney, the courtroom is our arena. Robbie Tolan is not an attorney, so he is going to take his case to an arena most favorable to him, that arena is the court of public opinion,\u201d said Crump. \u201cGod left Robbie Tolan here for a reason. Robbie is here to tell his own story. This family can now focus on the Robbie Tolan foundation and Robbie\u2019s book.\u201d \n \nRobbie still believes that his case is going to help a lot of people because the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court now states that a judge can no longer look at one side\u2019s evidence and not the others \u2013 which is what happened in Robbie\u2019s case.","title":"$110K: Is This What Justice Looks Like in America?","media-type":"News","source":"Black Press USA","published":"2015-09-22T17:27:57Z"}

Three more of their relatives were also injured in the incident, they further said. \n \nThe family from Sylhet city\u2019s Syedanibagh said the body of one of their family members \u2013 Shaheda Begum \u2013 has been identified, but another relative \u2013 Asma Begum \u2013 has been missing since Thursday\u2019s stampede. \n \nSyed Fazilat Hossain, brother-in-law of Shaheda, said five members of the family were together when the stampede took place. Asma\u2019s husband Syed Shakhawat Hossain and Shaheda\u2019s husband Sadeque Hossain lost consciousness during the crush and were rushed to local medical facilities. \n \nAfter regaining consciousness, they set out to find their wives and identified Shaheda\u2019s body at a Saudi hospital on Saturday; even though Asma could not be found, the family believes she had died, Fazilat told our correspondent. \n \nBrahmanbaria haji identified by brother \n \nA family in Brahmanbaria\u2019s Kasba upazila says one of their relatives, Jahedul Islam Bhuiyan Shwapan, had died in the Mina stampede. \n \nJahedul\u2019s elder brother Aminul Islam Bhuiyan said the news of the death was confirmed on Sunday by another brother who had been accompanying Jahedul in the pilgrimage. \n \nQuoting Khairul Islam Bhuiyan, the brother currently in Saudi Arabia, Aminul told our Brahmanbaria correspondent that Jahedul had been missing since the symbolic stoning of the devil. His body was later found at a morgue and identified using the identification card on the body.\u00a0","title":"HAAB: 11 confirmed Bangladeshi fatalities","media-type":"News","source":"Dhaka Tribune","published":"2015-09-28T18:43:54Z"}

I don\u2019t try to find guys that can just play, but it\u2019s finding guys that match my goals and my style\u2026 They\u2019ve got to be ultra competitive kids who aren\u2019t satisfied with where they\u2019re at.\u201d \n\nThe three true freshmen \u2013 Mitchell White, Alex Scott and Bryce Messner \u2013 were all top 1,500 recruits who spurned the likes of Oakland, Iowa and Eastern Michigan in favor of GVSU. \n\nAlthough it was no easy task for Bissell to sign such talent, his email inbox suggests that it was no easy task for the new recruits to make the squad. \n\n\u201cI get flooded with emails on a weekly basis of kids wanting to play here,\u201d Bissell said. \u201cThat\u2019s an important thing\u2026 (My players) know not to take this for granted because I got an email list of 300 kids who are dying to play here. You can\u2019t take this for granted because as soon as you start to slip up, there\u2019s someone waiting to take your spot.\u201d \n\nThe same philosophy applies for Bissell and his active roster. \n\nThe third-year Laker coach starts with a clean slate at the beginning of each season. Seniors have to prove themselves as much as freshmen do. What players did last year matters as much as what players claim they can do. \n\nFor White, Scott and Messner, this philosophy couldn\u2019t be better. Under Bissell\u2019s watch, the best players will be the ones who play, regardless of class standing. \n\nWhite is riding a wave of confidence as he adjusts to the college life. The Muskegon, Michigan native recently won the 94 th GAM Championship in a two-hole playoff to top some of the best amateur golfers in the area. \n\nWhite brushed off Oakland and EMU to play for Bissell in Allendale. The chance to create a base for future success played a big role in his decision. \n\n\u201cMe and Bryce (Messner) kind of committed at the same time and we tried pushing Alex (Scott) and when he came we realized we could have something special with us all here,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey guys on the team were all really nice once I was on campus for my official visit.\u201d \n\nScott was in the running for the last spot at Michigan State, but ultimately chose to be a Laker over a Spartan largely because of Bissell\u2019s knowledge as a swing coach and ability to impact a player\u2019s game. \n\nThe Traverse City West High School alum earned All-State honors as a junior and is the most highly rated recruit of the three. \n\n\u201cMy original goal when I got here was that I want to become the best player I can possibly be,\u201d Scott said. But my first goal is to actually get into that top 5. I know it\u2019s not going to be anything easy. I\u2019m going to really look forward to the challenge because there are players here that are going to push me.\u201d \n\nThe final member of the trio is Messner, a Hartland High School graduate and All-State First Team member as a junior in 2014. Messner ranked in the 800s out of high school and fired a 146 at the GAM Championship. \n\nThe three freshmen will room together this year \u2013 yet another instance of internal competition. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to help rooming with Alex and Bryce,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m watching TV or something and someone says,  \u2018Hey I\u2019m going to the course\u2019, then I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh wait, I\u2019ve got to practice with this guys, me and him are competing for the same spot.\u2019 Everyone is going to be pushing each other.\u201d \n\nThe Laker golf team could have a new look in 2016, but it just may be for the better. \n  Tweet","title":"Recruiting class looks bright for GVSU","media-type":"News","source":"Grand Valley Lanthorn","published":"2015-09-03T11:00:26Z"}

{"id":"97fd4e9b-20f3-4837-8cea-45a590dfab7c","content":"\u0130stanbul, along with other cities in northern Turkey, has been hit by heavy rain over the weekend, significantly affecting daily life while signaling the beginning of colder weather. \n \nOn Saturday morning rain clouds gathered over \u0130stanbul and a rain shower started around noon, causing floods in certain parts of the city. Avc\u0131lar, Beykoz , Beylikd\u00fcz\u00fc, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and Sar\u0131yer were some of the districts where the rain hit hardest. The flooding caused heavy damage to some houses and shops in these districts, with people having a difficult time trying to evacuate the water. \n \n(Photo: DHA) \n \nIn Beykoz, a coastal district along the Asian side of the Bosporus, the Beykoz-Riva highway was flooded by the heavy rain. The road was closed to traffic, and rescue teams made great efforts in pulling out cars that were half-submerged. \n \nKad\u0131k\u00f6y's notorious Kurba\u011fal\u0131dere creek was one of \u0130stanbul's most affected areas. When the stream overflowed, the surrounding neighborhoods had a hard time managing the floodwaters. Cars, the ground floors of many buildings and workplaces were damaged, and some cars were totally destroyed. \n \nKurba\u011fal\u0131dere also passes through Ata\u015fehir, one of the most luxurious districts of \u0130stanbul as it is the newest part of the city. Ata\u015fehir's Erc\u00fcment Batanay Avenue was submerged after the stream overflowed. \n \nKurba\u011fal\u0131dere has long been a much-debated issue for the locals of Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and Ata\u015fehir. As the two districts' mayors were from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), the \u0130stanbul Metropolitan Municipality, which has long been ruled by the Justice and Development Party ( AK Party ), neglected rehabilitation works for the stream. \n \nDespite heavy criticism of the municipality and strong concerns over Kurba\u011fal\u0131dere's negative effects on human health and the environment, the AK Party refused to take efficient steps to rehabilitate the stream. The overflowing of Kurba\u011fal\u0131dere over the weekend is only a recent example of how the AK Party's controversial policies trouble locals in parts of the country. \n \nPublic transportation in \u0130stanbul was also affected by the downpour, which continued throughout Saturday. In addition to \u0130stanbul Ferry Lines (\u0130DO) canceling some trips on certain routes, tram journeys were also canceled between two central \u0130stanbul neighborhoods -- Beyaz\u0131t and Aksaray -- with a cable damaged because of the rain. Moreover, some flights departing from \u0130stanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport and \u0130stanbul Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport were also canceled during the hours when the rain hit hardest. Pedestrians in Turkey's most crowded city were also affected negatively by the unusually long and heavy summer rain, with some of them taking shelter under any little space they could find. \n \nThe rain in \u0130stanbul continued on Sunday with occasional cloudbursts in Bayrampa\u015fa, Gaziosmanpa\u015fa, Kad\u0131k\u00f6y and other surrounding districts. \n \nThe heavy rain also hit other cities in the Marmara region, where \u0130stanbul is located, and the Black Sea region. Daylight almost completely faded in Bursa, with dark clouds and heavy rain storming the city. \n \nThe northern Black Sea region was also affected by the rain that began on Saturday and continued into Sunday, when it also became heavier. Bart\u0131n, Bolu, Kastamonu and Zonguldak were just some of the provinces that witnessed a heavy downpour, which affected daily life greatly. The rainfall is estimated to have reached up to 50 kilograms of water per square meter. Meteorologists expect the rain in the Black Sea region to continue throughout the week. \n \nAccording to the website of the State Meteorological Service (DM\u0130), there will be no more rain in \u0130stanbul this week, but its five-day prediction states that the city will be partly cloudy.","title":"Heavy rain hits \u0130stanbul, paralyzes daily life","media-type":"News","source":"Zaman","published":"2015-09-13T16:41:46Z"}

{"id":"727631da-4b4b-49e6-8026-46274f3892d6","content":"This blog is an unedited version of the speech delivered by to the Labour Party Conference in Brighton, Tuesday 29 September \n\nFriends, thank you so much for that incredible welcome and Rohit, thank you so much for that incredible welcome. Rohit, thank you so much for the way you introduced me and the way our family and you have contributed so much to our community. That was absolutely brilliant. Thank you very much. \n\nI am truly delighted to be invited to make this speech today, because for the past two weeks, as you've probably known I've had a very easy, relaxing time. Hardly anything of any importance at all has happened to me. \n\nYou might have noticed in some of our newspapers they've taken a bit of an interest in me lately. Some of the things I've read are this. According to one headline \"Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the prospect of an asteroid 'wiping out' humanity.\" Now, asteroids are pretty controversial. It's not the kind of policy I'd want this party to adopt without a full debate in conference. So can we have the debate later in the week! \n\nAnother newspaper went even further and printed a 'mini-novel' that predicted how life would look if I were Prime Minister. It's pretty scary I have to tell you. It tells us football's Premier League would collapse, which makes sense, because it's quite difficult to see how all our brilliant top 20 teams in the Premiership would cope with playing after an asteroid had wiped out humanity. So that's a no-no for sure! \n\nAnd then the Daily Express informed readers that - I'm not quite sure how many greats there are here, but I think there are three or four - great-great-great grandfather, who I'd never heard of before was a very unpleasant sort of chap who apparently was involved in running a workhouse. I want to take this opportunity to apologise for not doing the decent thing and going back in time to have a chat with him about his appalling behaviour. \n\nBut then there's another journalist who had obviously been hanging around my street a great deal, who quotes: \"Neighbours often see him riding a Chairman Mao style bicycle.\" Less thorough journalists might just have referred to it as just a 'bicycle', but no. \n\nSo we have to conclude that whenever we see someone on a bicycle from now on, there goes another supporter of Chairman Mao. Thus, the Daily Express has changed history. \n\nBut seriously, conference it's a huge honour and a privilege for me to speak to you today as Leader of the Labour Party. To welcome all our new members. More than 160,000 have joined the Labour Party. And more than 50,000 have joined since the declaration of the leadership and deputy leadership election results. \n\nI'm very proud to say that in my own constituency, our membership as of last night had just gone over 3,000 individual members and 2,000 registered supporters. 5,000 people in my constituency. \n\nI want to say first of all thank you to all of the people of my constituency of Islington North and Islington North Labour party for their friendship, support and all the activities we've done and all the help and support they've given me in the past few weeks. I'm truly grateful to you. Thank you very much indeed to everyone in Islington. \n\nAbove I want to welcome all our new members to this party, everyone who's joined this party in this great endeavour. To change our party, change our country, change our politics and change the way we do things. Above all I want to speak to everyone in Britain about the tasks Labour has now turned to. \n\nOpposing and fighting the Tory government and the huge damage it is doing. Developing Labour's alternative. Renewing our policies so we can reach out across the country and win. Starting next year. In Wales. In Scotland. In London. In Bristol. In local government elections across Britain. \n\nI want to repeat the thanks I gave after my election to all the people who have served the Labour Party so well in recent months and years. \n\nTo Ed Miliband for the leadership he gave our party, and for the courage and dignity he showed in the face of tawdry media attacks. And also for the contribution I know he will be making in the future. Especially on the vital issues of the environment and climate change.  Thank you Ed. Thank you so much for all you've done. \n\nAnd to Harriet Harman not just for her leadership and service, but for her commitment and passion for equality and the rights of women. The way she has changed attitudes and law through her courage and determination. The Equality Act is one of many testaments to her huge achievements. Thank you, Harriet, for everything you've done and everything you continue to do. \n\nI also want to say a big thank you to Iain McNicol, our general secretary, and all our party staff in London and Newcastle and all over the country for their dedication and hard work during the General Election and leadership election campaigns. \n\nAnd also to all the staff and volunteers who are doing such a great job here this week in Brighton at this incredible conference we're holding. Thank you to all of them. They're part of our movement and part of our conference. \n\nAlso I want to say a special thank you to the fellow candidates who contested the leadership election for this party. It was an amazing three month experience for all of us. \n\nI want to say thank you to Liz Kendall, for her passion, her independence, determination and her great personal friendship to me throughout the campaign. Liz, thank you so much for that and all you contribute to the party. \n\nI want to say thank you to Yvette Cooper for the remarkable way in which she's helped to change public attitudes towards the refugee crisis. And now for leading a taskforce on how Britain and Europe can do more to respond to this crisis. Yvette, thank you for that. \n\nAnd to Andy Burnham, our new Shadow Home Secretary, for everything he did as Health Secretary to defend our NHS - health service free at the point if use as a human right for all. I want to say thank you to all three for the spirit and friendship with which they contested the election. Thank you Liz. Thank you Yvette. Thank you Andy. \n\nI want to thank all those who took part in that election, at hustings and rallies all across the country. Our Party at its best, democratic, inclusive and growing. I've got new people to thank as well. The talented colleagues working with me in the Shadow Cabinet and on Labour's front bench. An inclusive team from all political wings of our party. From every part of our country. It gives us the right foundation for the open debate our party must now have about the future. I am not a leader who wants to impose leadership lines all the time. I don't believe anyone of us has a monopoly on wisdom and ideas - we all have ideas and a vision of how things can be better. I want open debate in our party and our movement. I will listen to everyone. \n\nI firmly believe leadership is about listening. We will reach out to our new members and supporters. Involve people in our debates on policy and then our party as a whole will decide. \n\nI've been given a huge mandate, by 59% of the electorate who supported my campaign. I believe it is a mandate for change. I want to explain how. First and foremost it's a vote for change in the way we do politics. In the Labour Party and in the country. Politics that's kinder, more inclusive. Bottom up, not top down. In every community and workplace, not just in Westminster. Real debate, not necessarily message discipline all the time. But above all, straight talking. Honest. That's the politics we're going to have in the future in this party and in this movement. And it was a vote for political change in our party as well. \n\nLet me be clear under my leadership, and we discussed this yesterday in conference, Labour will be challenging austerity. It will be unapologetic about reforming our economy to challenge inequality and protect workers better. \n\nAnd internationally Labour will be a voice for engagement in partnership with those who share our values. Supporting the authority of international law and international institutions, not acting against them. \n\nThe global environment is in peril. We need to be part of an international movement to cut emissions and pollution. To combat the environmental danger to our planet. \n\nThese are crucial issues. But I also want to add this. I've been standing up for human rights, challenging oppressive regimes for 30 years as a backbench MP. And before that as an individual activist, just like everyone else in this hall. Just because I've become the leader of this party, I'm not going to stop standing up on those issues or being that activist. So for my first message to David Cameron, I say to him now a little message from our conference, I hope he's listening - you never know: \n\nIntervene now personally with the Saudi Arabian regime to stop the beheading and crucifixion of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who is threatened with the death penalty, for taking part in a demonstration at the age of 17. And while you're about it, terminate that bid made by our Ministry of Justice's to provide services for Saudi Arabia - which would be required to carry out the sentence that would be put down on Mohammed Ali al-Nimr. \n\nWe have to be very clear about what we stand for in human rights. A refusal to stand up is the kind of thing that really damages Britain's standing in the world. I have huge admiration for human rights defenders all over the world. I've met hundreds of these very brave people during my lifetime working on international issues. I want to say a special mention to one group who've campaigned for the release of British resident Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay. \n\nThis was a campaign of ordinary people like you and me, standing on cold draughty streets, for many hours over many years. Together we secured this particular piece of justice. That's how our human rights were won by ordinary people coming together. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things - that is how our rights and our human rights have been won. The Tories want to repeal the Human Rights Act and some want leave the European convention on Human Rights. Just to show what they're made of, their new Trade Union Bill which we're opposing very strongly in the House and the country, is also a fundamental attack on human rights and is in breach of both the ILO and the European Convention on Human Rights. \n\nNow I've been listening to a lot of advice about how to do this job. There's plenty of advice around, believe me. Actually I quite like that.  I welcome that. I like to listen to advice, particularly the advice which is unwelcome. That is often the best advice you get. The people that tell you, \"yes, you're doing great, you're brilliant, you're wonderful\". Fine. Thank you, but what have I got wrong? \"Oh, I haven't got time for that.\" \n\nI want to listen to people. But I do like to do things differently as well. I've been told never to repeat your opponents' lines in a political debate. But I want to tackle one thing head on. The Tories talk about economic and family security being at risk from us the Labour party, or perhaps even more particularly, from me. \n\nI say this to them. How dare these people talk about security for families and people in Britain? \n\nWhere's the security for families shuttled around the private rented sector on six month tenancies - with children endlessly having to change schools? \n\nWhere's the security for those tenants afraid to ask a landlord to fix a dangerous structure in their own homes because they might be evicted because they've gone to the local authority to seek the justice they're entitled to? \n\nWhere's the security for the carers struggling to support older family members as Tory local government cuts destroy social care and take away the help they need? \n\nWhere's the security for young people starting out on careers knowing they are locked out of any prospect of ever buying their own home by soaring house prices? \n\nWhere's the security for families driven away from their children's schools, their community and family ties by these welfare cuts? \n\nWhere's the security for the hundreds of thousands taking on self-employment with uncertain income, no sick pay, no Maternity Pay, no paid leave, no pension now facing the loss of the tax credits that keep them and their families afloat? \n\nAnd there's no security for the 2.8million households in Britain forced into debt by stagnating wages and the Tory record of the longest fall in living standards since records began. \n\nAnd that's the nub of it. Tory economic failure. An economy that works for the few, not for the many. Manufacturing still in decline. Look at the Tory failure to intervene to support our steel industry as the Italian government has done. \n\nSo, as we did yesterday in conference, we stand with the people on Teesside fighting for their jobs, their industry and their community. The company has said that it will mothball the plant and lay the workers off, therefore it is not too late now, again, to call on the Prime Minister even at this late stage, this 12th hour, to step in and defend those people, like the Italian government has done. Why can't the British government? What is wrong with them? \n\nThere's an investment crisis. Britain at the bottom of the international league on investment. Just below Madagascar and just above El Salvador.  So we're doing quite well! Britain's balance of payment deficit \u00a3100billion last year. Loading our economy and every one of us with unsustainable debt for the future. And the shocks in world markets this summer have shown what a dangerous and fragile state the world economy is in. And how ill prepared the Tories have left us to face another crisis. It hasn't been growing exports and a stronger manufacturing sector that have underpinned the feeble economic recovery. It's house price inflation, asset inflation, more private debt. \n\nUnbalanced. Unsustainable. Dangerous. The real risk to economic and family security. To people who have had to stretch to take on mortgages. To people who have only kept their families afloat through relying on their credit cards, and payday loans. Fearful of how they will cope with a rise in interest rates. It's not acceptable. \n\nThe Tories' austerity is the out-dated and failed approach of the past. So it's for us, for Labour to develop our forward-looking alternative. That's what John McDonnell started to do in his excellent speech to conference. At the heart of it is investing for the future. Every mainstream economist will tell you that with interest rates so low now is the time for public investment in our infrastructure. Investment in council housing, and for affordable homes to rent and to buy. \n\nJohn Healey's plan for 100,000 new council and housing association homes a year. To tackle the housing crisis, drive down the spiralling housing benefit bill and so to make the taxpayer a profit. A profit for the taxpayer because the benefit bill falls when the cost of housing falls. It's quite simple actually and quite a good idea. \n\nInvestment in fast broadband to support new high technology jobs. A National Investment Bank to support investment in infrastructure. To provide finance to small and medium sized firms that our banks continue to starve of the money they need to grow. \n\nA Green New Deal investing in renewable energy and energy conservation to tackle the threat of climate change. The Tories of course are selling off the Green Investment Bank. They are simply not interested in this. This is the only way to a strong economic future for Britain. That's sustainable. That turns round the terrible trade deficit. That supports high growth firms and businesses. That provides real economic security for our people. \n\nThe economy of the future depends on the investment we make today in infrastructure, skills, and schools. I'm delighted that Lucy Powell is our new shadow education secretary. She has already set out how the education of every child and the quality of every school counts. Every school accountable to local government, not bringing back selection. We have aspirations for all children, not just a few. \n\nNow my first public engagement as Labour leader came within an hour of being elected. I was proud to speak at the 'Refugees Welcome' rally in London. I wanted to send out a message of the kinder politics we are pursuing and a caring society we want to achieve. I have been inspired by people across our country. Making collections for the refugees in Calais. Donating to charities. The work of Citizens UK to involve whole communities in this effort. These refugees are the victims of war - many the victims of the brutal conflict in Syria. It is a huge crisis, the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. And globally it's the biggest refugee crisis there has ever been. \n\nBut the scale of the response from the government, Europe and the international community isn't enough. And whilst the government is providing welcome aid to the region, especially in the Lebanon, we all know much more needs to be done. Because it's a crisis of human beings just like you and just like me looking for security and looking for safety. Let's reach out the hand of humanity and friendship to them. \n\nNow let me say something about national security. The best way to protect the British people against the threats we face to our safety at home and abroad is to work to resolve conflict. That isn't easy, but it is unavoidable if we want real security. Our British values are internationalist and universal. They are not limited by borders. \n\nBritain does need strong, modern military and security forces to keep us safe. And to take a lead in humanitarian and peace keeping missions - working with and strengthening the United Nations. On my first day in Parliament as Labour leader it was a privilege to meet the soldiers and medics who did such remarkable work in tackling the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone. There is no contradiction between working for peace across the world and doing what is necessary to keep us safe. \n\nToday we face very different threats from the time of the Cold War which ended thirty years ago. That's why I have asked our shadow defence secretary, Maria Eagle, to lead a debate and review about how we deliver that strong, modern effective protection for the people of Britain. \n\nI've made my own position on one issue clear. And I believe I have a mandate from my election on it. \n\nI don't believe \u00a3100 billion on a new generation of nuclear weapons taking up a quarter of our defence budget is the right way forward. \n\nI believe Britain should honour our obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty and lead in making progress on international nuclear disarmament. \n\nBut in developing our policy through the review we must make sure we all the jobs and skills of everyone in every aspect of the defence industry are fully protected and fully utilised so that we gain from this, we don't lose from this. To me, that is very important. \n\nAnd on foreign policy we need to learn the lessons of the recent past. \n\nIt didn't help our national security that, at the same time I was protesting outside the Iraqi Embassy about Saddam Hussein's brutality, Tory ministers were secretly conniving with illegal arms sales to his regime. \n\nIt didn't help our national security when we went to war with Iraq in defiance of the United Nations and on a false prospectus. \n\nIt didn't help our national security to endure the loss of hundreds of brave British soldiers in that war while making no proper preparation for what to do after the fall of the regime. \n\nNor does it help our national security to give such fawning and uncritical support to regimes like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - who abuse their own citizens and repress democratic rights. These are issues we have to stand up on and also recognise in some cases they are using British weapons in their assault on Yemen. We have got to be clear on where our objectives are. \n\nBut there is a recent object lesson in how real leadership can resolve conflicts, prevent war and build real security. It's the leadership, the clever and difficult diplomacy that has been shown by Barack Obama and others in reaching the historic deal with Iran. A deal that opens the way for new diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Syria. The scale of the destruction and suffering in Syria is truly dreadful. More than a quarter of a million people killed. More than ten million driven from their homes. I yield to no-one in my opposition to the foul and despicable crimes committed by Isil and by the Assad government including barrel bombs being dropped on civilian targets. \n\nWe all want the atrocities to stop and the Syrian people free to determine their own destiny. But the answer to this complex and tragic conflict can't simply be found in a few more bombs. I agree with Paddy Ashdown when he says that military strikes against Isil aren't succeeding, not because we do not have enough high explosives, but because we do not have a diplomatic strategy on Syria. \n\nThat's the challenge for leadership now, for us, for David Cameron. The clever, patient, difficult diplomacy Britain needs to play a leading role in. That's why Hilary Benn and I together are calling for a new United Nations Security Council resolution that can underpin a political solution to the crisis. I believe the UN can yet bring about a process that leads to an end to the violence in Syria. Yesterday's meetings in New York were very important. \n\nSocial democracy itself was exhausted. Dead on its feet. Yet something new and invigorating, popular and authentic has exploded. To understand this all of us have to share our ideas and our contributions. Our common project must be to embrace the emergence of a modern left movement and harness it to build a society for the majority. \n\nNow some media commentators who've spent years complaining about how few people have engaged with political parties have sneered at our huge increase in membership. If they were sports reporters writing about a football team they'd be saying: \"They've had a terrible summer. They've got 160,000 new fans. Season tickets are sold out. The new supporters are young and optimistic. I don't know how this club can survive a crisis like this.\" \n\nWe celebrate the enthusiasm of so many people, old and young, from all communities. In every part of the country. Joining Labour as members and supporters. And we need to change in response to this movement. Our new members want to be active and involved. Want to have a say in our Labour Party's policies. Want to lead local and national campaigns against injustice and the dreadful impact of Tory austerity. Want to work in their local communities to make people's lives better. They don't want to do things the old way. Young people and older people are fizzing with ideas. Let's give them the space for that fizz to explode into the joy we want of a better society. \n\nThey want a new politics of engagement and involvement. Many of them are already active in their communities, in voluntary organisations, in local campaigns. And we've convinced them now to take a further step and join our Labour Party. What a tremendous opportunity for our Labour Party to be the hub of every community. The place where people come together to campaign. To debate, to build friendships, to set up new community projects. To explain and talk to their neighbours about politics, about changing Britain for the better. \n\nThat's going to mean a lot of change for the way we've done our politics in the past. Our new deputy leader Tom Watson is well up for that challenge. He's leading the charge and leading the change of the much greater use of digital media as a key resource. That is the way of communication, it is not just through broadsheet newspapers or tabloids, it's social media that really is the point of communication of the future. We have got to get that. \n\nOne firm commitment I make to people who join our Labour Party is that you have a real say, the final say in deciding on the policies of our party. No-one - not me as leader, not the Shadow Cabinet, not the Parliamentary Labour Party - is going to impose policy or have a veto. \n\nThe media commentariat don't get it. They've been keen to report disagreements as splits: agreement and compromise as concessions and capitulation. No. This is grown up politics. Where people put forward different views. We debate issues. We take a decision and we go forward together. We look to persuade each other. On occasions we might agree to disagree. But whatever the outcome we stand together, united as Labour, to put forward a better way to the misery on offer from the Conservatives. \n\nThere's another important thing about how we are going to do this.  It's a vital part of our new politics. I want to repeat what I said at the start of the leadership election. I do not believe in personal abuse of any sort. Treat people with respect. Treat people as you wish to be treated yourself. Listen to their views, agree or disagree but have that debate. There is going to be no rudeness from me. Maya Angelou said: \"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\" I want a kinder politics, a more caring society. Don't let them reduce you to believing in anything less. So I say to all activists, whether Labour or not, cut out the personal attacks. The cyberbullying. And especially the misogynistic abuse online. And let's get on with bringing values back into politics. \n\nSo what are our first big campaigns?  I want to start with a fundamental issue about democratic rights for Britain. Just before Parliament rose for the summer the Tories sneaked out a plan to strike millions of people off the electoral register this December. A year earlier than the advice of the independent Electoral Commission. It means two million or more people could lose their right to vote. That's 400,000 people in London. It's 70,000 people in Glasgow. Thousands in every town and city, village and hamlet all across the country. That's overwhelmingly students, people in insecure accommodation, and short stay private lets. We know why the Tories are doing it. They want to gerrymander next year's Mayoral election in London by denying hundreds of thousands of Londoners their right to vote.  They want to do the same for the Assembly elections in Wales. And they want to gerrymander electoral boundaries across the country. By ensuring new constituencies are decided on the basis of the missing registers when the Boundary Commission starts its work in April 2016. \n\nConference, we are going to do our best to stop them. We will highlight this issue in Parliament and outside. We will work with Labour councils across the country to get people back on the registers. And from today our Labour Party starts a nationwide campaign for all our members to work in every town and city, in every university as students start the new term, to stop the Tory gerrymander. To get people on the electoral register. It's hard work - as I know from 10 years as the election agent for a marginal London constituency. But now we have new resources. The power of social media. The power of our huge new membership. Conference, let's get to it. Get those people on the register to give us those victories but also to get fairness within our society. \n\nAnd, friends, we need to renew our party in Scotland. I want to pay tribute today to our leader in Scotland, Kezia Dugdale and her team of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament. I know that people in Scotland have been disappointed by the Labour Party. I know you feel we lost our way. I agree with you. Kezia has asked people to take another look at the Labour Party. And that's what I want people across Scotland to do. Under Kezia and my leadership we will change. We will learn the lessons of the past. And we will again make Labour the great fighting force you expect us to be. We need to be investing in skills, investing in our young people - not cutting student numbers. Giving young people real hope and real opportunity. Conference, it is Labour that is the progressive voice for Scotland. \n\nThere's another big campaign we need to lead. David Cameron's attack on the living standards of low paid workers and their families through the assault on tax credits. First, remind people over and over again David Cameron pledged during the election not to cut child tax credits. On the Question Time leader's debate he said he had rejected child tax credit cuts. \n\nIt's a shocking broken promise - and the Tories voted it through in Parliament just two weeks ago. How can it be right for a single mother working as a part time nurse earning just \u00a318,000 to lose \u00a32,000 to this broken promise? Some working families losing nearly \u00a33,500 a year to this same broken promise. And how can it be right or fair to break this promise while handing out an inheritance tax cut to 60,000 of the wealthiest families in the country?  See the contrast? So we'll fight this every inch of the way. \n\nAnd we'll campaign at the workplace, in every community against this Tory broken promise. And to expose the absurd lie that the Tories are on the side of working people, that they are giving Britain a pay rise. It was one of the proudest days of my life when cycling home from Parliament at 5 o'clock in the morning having voted for the national minimum wage legislation to go through. So of course it's good to see a minimum wage. But the phoney rebranding of it as a living wage doesn't do anyone any good. And the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown Cameron's broken promise mean millions of workers are still left far worse off. They can and must be changed. \n\nAs I travelled the country during the leadership campaign it was wonderful to see the diversity of all the people in our country. And that is now being reflected in our membership with more black, Asian and ethnic minority members joining our party. Even more inspiring is the unity and unanimity of their values. A belief in coming together to achieve more than we can on our own. Fair play for all. Solidarity and not walking by on the other side of the street when people are in trouble. Respect for other people's point of view. \n\nIt is this sense of fair play, these shared majority British values that are the fundamental reason why I love this country and its people. These values are what I was elected on: a kinder politics and a more caring society. They are Labour values and our country's values. We're going to put these values back into politics. I want to rid Britain of injustice, to make it fairer, more decent, more equal. And I want all our citizens to benefit from prosperity and success. \n\nThere is nothing good about cutting support to the children of supermarket workers and cleaners. There is nothing good about leaving hundreds of thousands unable to feed themselves, driving them to foodbanks that have almost become an institution. And there is nothing good about a Prime Minister wandering around Europe trying to bargain away the rights that protect our workers. \n\nAs our Conference decided yesterday we will oppose that and stand up for the vision of a social Europe, a Europe of unity and solidarity, to defend those rights. I am proud of our history. It is a history of courageous people who defied overwhelming odds to fight for the rights and freedoms we enjoy today. The rights of women to vote. The rights and dignity of working people; Our welfare state. \n\nThe NHS - rightly at the centre of Danny Boyle's great Olympic opening ceremony. The BBC.  Both great institutions. Both under attack by the Tories. Both threatened by the idea that profit comes first, not the needs and interests of our people. That's the difference between us and the Tories. \n\nSo let me make this commitment. Our Labour Party will always put people's interests before profit. \n\nNow I want to say a bit more about policy - and the review that Angela Eagle has announced this week. Let's start by recognising the huge amount of agreement we start from, thanks to the work that Angela led in the National Policy Forum. Then we need to be imaginative and recognise the ways our country is changing. In my leadership campaign I set out some ideas for how we should support small businesses and the self-employed. That's because one in seven of the labour force now work for themselves. Some of them have been driven into it as their only response to keep an income coming in, insecure though it is. \n\nBut many people like the independence and flexibility self-employment brings to their lives, the sense of being your own boss. And that's a good thing. But with that independence comes insecurity and risk especially for those on the lowest and most volatile incomes. There's no Statutory Sick Pay if they have an accident at work. There's no Statutory Maternity Pay for women when they become pregnant. They have to spend time chasing bigger firms to pay their invoices on time, so they don't slip further into debt. They earn less than other workers. On average just \u00a311,000 a year. And their incomes have been hit hardest by five years of Tory economic failure. \n\nSo what are the Tories doing to help the self-employed, the entrepreneurs they claim to represent? They're clobbering them with the tax credit cuts. And they are going to clobber them again harder as they bring in Universal Credit. So I want our policy review to tackle this in a really serious way. And be reflective of what modern Britain is actually like. \n\nLabour created the welfare state as an expression of a caring society - but all too often that safety net has holes in it, people fall through it, and it is not there for the self-employed.  It must be. That is the function of a universal welfare state. Consider opening up Statutory Maternity and Paternity Pay to the self-employed so all new born children can get the same level of care from their parents. \n\nI've asked Angela Eagle, our shadow business secretary, and Owen Smith, our shadow work and pensions secretary, to look at all the ways we can we support self-employed people and help them to grow their businesses. \n\nAnd I want to thank Lillian Greenwood, our shadow transport secretary for the speed and skill with which she has moved policy on the future of our railways forward. It was wonderful to see Conference this morning agree our new plan to bring private franchises into public ownership as they expire. Labour's policy now is to deliver the fully integrated, publicly owned railway the British people want and need. That's the Labour policy, that's the one we'll deliver on. \n\nHousing policy too is a top priority. Perhaps nowhere else has Tory failure been so complete and so damaging to our people. In the last parliament at least half a million fewer homes built than needed. Private rents out of control. A third of private rented homes not meeting basic standards of health and safety. The chance of owning a home a distant dream for the vast majority of young people. \n\nThere's no answer to this crisis that doesn't start with a new council house-building programme. With new homes that are affordable to rent and to buy. As John Healey, our shadow housing minister, has shown it can pay for itself and make the taxpayer a profit by cutting the housing benefit bill by having reasonable rents, not exorbitant rents. And we need new ideas to tackle land hoarding and land speculation. \n\nThese are issues that are so vital to how things go forward in this country. I want a kinder, more caring politics that does not tolerate more homelessness, more upheaval for families in temporary accommodation. A secure home is currently out of reach for millions. And John Healey has already made a great start on a fundamental review of our housing policies to achieve that. \n\nAnd we are going to make mental health a real priority. It's an issue for all of us. Every one of us can have a mental health problem. So let's end the stigma. End the discrimination. And with Luciana Berger, our shadow minister for mental health, I'm going to challenge the Tories to make parity of esteem for mental health a reality not a slogan. \n\nWith increased funding - especially for services for children and young people. As three quarters of chronic mental health problems start before the age of 18. Yet only a quarter of those young people get the help they need. All our work on policy will be underpinned by Labour's values. End the stigma, end the discrimination, treat people with mental health conditions as you would wish to be treated yourself. That's our pledge. Let's put them back into politics. Let's build that kinder, more caring world. \n\nSince the dawn of history in virtually every human society there are some people who are given a great deal and many more people who are given little or nothing. Some people have property and power, class and capital, status and clout which are denied to the many. And time and time again, the people who receive a great deal tell the many to be grateful to be given anything at all. They say that the world cannot be changed and the many must accept the terms on which they are allowed to live in it. These days this attitude is justified by economic theory. The many with little or nothing are told they live in a global economy whose terms cannot be changed. They must accept the place assigned to them by competitive markets. \n\nBy the way, isn't it curious that globalisation always means low wages for poor people, but is used to justify massive payments to top chief executives. Our Labour Party came into being to fight that attitude. That is still what our Labour Party is all about. Labour is the voice that says to the many, at home and abroad: \"you don't have to take what you're given.\" \n\nLabour says: \n\n\"You may be born poor but you don't have to stay poor. You don't have to live without power and without hope. \n\n\"You don't have to set limits on your talent and your ambition - or those of your children. \n\n\"You don't have to accept prejudice and discrimination, or sickness or poverty, or destruction and war. \n\n\"You don't have to be grateful to survive in a world made by others. \n\nNo, you set the terms for the people in power over you, and you dismiss them when they fail you.\" \n\nThat's what democracy is about. That has always been our Labour Party's message. You don't have to take what you're given. It was the great Nigerian writer Ben Okri who perhaps put it best: \"The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love\". \n\nBut they're at it again. The people who want you to take what you're given. This Tory government. This government which was made by the few - and paid for by the few. Since becoming leader David Cameron has received \u00a355million in donations from hedge funds. From people who have a lot and want to keep it all. That is why this pre-paid government came into being. To protect the few and tell all the rest of us to accept what we're given. To deliver the \u00a3145million tax break they have given the hedge funds in return. \n\nThey want us to believe there is no alternative to cutting jobs. Slashing public services. Vandalising the NHS. Cutting junior doctors' pay. Reducing care for the elderly. Destroying the hopes of young people for a college education or putting university graduates into massive debt. Putting half a million more children in poverty. \n\nThey want the people of Britain to accept all of these things. They expect millions of people to work harder and longer for a lower quality of life on lower wages. Well, they're not having it. Our Labour Party says no. The British people never have to take what they are given. And certainly not when it comes from Cameron and Osborne. \n\nSo conference, I come almost to the end of my first conference speech, and I think you for listening OK, alright, don't worry. Listen, I've spoken at 37 meetings since Saturday afternoon, is that not enough? We'll talk later... \n\nSo I end conference with a quote. \n\nThe last bearded man to lead the Labour Party was a wonderful great Scotsman, Keir Hardie, who died about a century ago this weekend and we commemorated him with a book we launched on Sunday evening.

Reuters\/Yuri Gripas    \nU.S. Democratic voters would choose Vice President Joe Biden as their preferred candidate for president in 2016 if current frontrunner Hillary Clinton shows signs of faltering, according to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday. \n\nMore than 38 percent of Democrats polled said they would vote for Biden in the Democratic Party nominating contest, if polling indicated that Clinton would lose to a Republican candidate. \n\nThirty percent of Democratic voters said they would back liberal Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders should Clinton, a former secretary of state, run into trouble, according to the tracking poll conducted from Aug. 28 through Sept. 1. \n\nFewer than a quarter of voters said they would stick by Clinton. The survey suggested that while Clinton's support is broad, voters are far from committed, which could indicate risks for her if Biden were to jump into the race. \n\nBiden has been consulting with advisers over whether he should launch a 2016 presidential bid. With the first Democratic presidential primary debate planned for Oct. 13, Biden is under pressure to make a decision within the next few weeks. \n \nA total of 499 people who identified themselves as Democrats took part in the poll, which had a credibility interval of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points. \n\nClinton remains the top choice for Democratic voters, with more than 44 percent favoring the former first lady, according to Tuesday's Reuters\/Ipsos polling data. Sanders had the support of a quarter of those surveyed, and Biden almost 17 percent. \n \nBut Clinton's lead narrowed in recent days as her polling numbers fell below 50 percent in August and as Sanders, a self-described socialist, drew a bit closer. \n\nSanders' campaign has focused on wealth inequality and the economic struggles of the middle class. He has drawn large crowds and has appeared to gain traction especially among students, according to Reuters\/Ipsos polling. \n\nVoters in various polls have said they lack trust in Clinton as she struggles with a controversy over her use of a private email server for official business during her tenure as the top U.S. diplomat. \n \nThe FBI is investigating the security of the private server and any classified information on it. Clinton says she did nothing wrong and only used the private account out of convenience. \n\nAn August interview survey of 22 voters who had participated in Reuters\/Ipsos polling and supported Biden found many of them describing the vice president as \"honest,\" \"genuine\" and \"trustworthy.\" \n\n\n(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Leslie Adler)","title":"Biden is top choice of Democrats if Clinton falters: Reuters\/Ipsos poll","media-type":"News","source":"Reuters","published":"2015-09-01T22:30:15Z"}

Go on, I dare you. Lydia or Lisa? Carrington or Ko? It's the impossible question with two right answers and no wrong one. \n \nMy goodness what a time it is for Kiwi women's sport. When Lisa Carrington, the micro marvel with the sparkling smile and gorgeous guns, won two gold medals in Olympic events at the world canoe racing championships in late-August she laid down a heck of a marker. \n \nI can remember vividly a conversation with champion rower Eric Murray earlier this year in which he assured me what Carrington was achieving in her sport was every bit as impressive as what they were doing in theirs. Two golds in Olympic events, he felt, would put her on a lofty pedestal. \n \nWell, she achieved that in Italy and immediately shot to favouritism for New Zealand's female athlete of the year at the Halbergs. It would be an overdue honour, too, given the Olympic gold medallist and multiple world champion has never walked off with a gong from New Zealand's annual sporting awards. \n \nOf course she has had a certain Valerie Adams and Lydia Ko to contend with in recent years, and in the game of comparing apples with oranges with grapefruit she has been, well, narrowly pipped by two quality operators. \n \nBut after her golden double in Italy it seemed like her time had arrived. Among a group of sporting smarties not too far from the desk I call home, the consensus was only a golf major could deny her now. \n \nWell, wouldn't you know it, the magnificent Ko has gone and delivered that very outcome, achieved in sensational fashion at the Evian Championship in France. At 18 she became the youngest winner of a women's major, and her final-round bogey-free 63 was the lowest closing score in women's championship history. \u00a0It has been matched only in the men's game by Johnny Miller's epic last 18 holes to claim the 1973 US Open at Oakmont. \n \nSo now we have ourselves a water cooler sporting conversation for the summer. Ko or Carrington? You might as well argue Monet or Picasso? Jordan or James? The sublime or the majestic? \n \nThere will come a time when the merits of both achievements will have to be poked and prodded, weighed and assessed. I'm on the panel that chooses the Halberg winners and believe me, despite the opinions of some, we take these decisions very seriously indeed. \n \nBut for now let's not evaluate, let's just celebrate. Let's bathe in the glory of two fabulous New Zealand women who are not only great champions, but great people. \n \nBoth Carrington and Ko not only win, but do so with a dignity and delight that makes you proud to be a Kiwi. \n \nThere is plenty wrong in sport these days, but none of it involves either of these two brilliant competitors. \n \nWhen you consider what Lauren Boyle achieves in the truly global sport of swimming and that Adams will assuredly be back adding to her remarkable achievements as soon as she can sort her injury issues out, New Zealand really has been blessed by the accomplishments of its sportswomen. \n    \nEventually my colleagues and I will have to decide which outranks which. A golf major at the age of 18, or a double world triumph in a canoe? \n \nThat won't be an easy deliberation. Ko's achievements this year even without the major triumph have been special. Now she has the icing on her cake. \n \nBut gee, Carrington is a wonderful package of grace and grunt. \n \nNow, all we need is the All Blacks to win a certain golden trophy in England and we will really have ourselves a conversation. \n              \r     Comments","title":"Hinton: Lydia Ko or Lisa Carrington?

Only John Isner has made Federer work for his win en route to the semifinals, but even then, the Swiss master was able to see off the American's challenge in straight sets. \n \nThe form that Federer is in was highlighted in the 17-time Grand Slam champion's demolition of Richard Gasquet, who simply had no answer to the Swiss ace's game, despite coming into the match in prime form. \n \n\"Two steps [to go for the title], but they are not [small steps]. They are like... you know what I mean. Hours of work and sleeps and waits and nerves and all that. It's still a long way. \n \n\"I feel like I'm close, of course. You enter now a territory which is very interesting, and definitely Stan is going to present the big test for me. Don't look further than that, to be quite honest.\" \n\nThe way Federer is playing, you know Wawrinka will need to produce some extraordinary tennis to stop his compatriot, but the great man feels the No.5 seed is capable of producing that kind of \"wow this is just incredible\" tennis in this semifinal of the US Open 2015. \n \n\"I believe Stan can bring it, you know,\" Federer added. \"That's my No. 1 focus, that I make it as hard as possible for him to beat me. Personally I'm very happy with the where my game is at. It's just a matter of keeping it up and adjusting to Stan now.\" \n \nIf Federer was impressive in his quarterfinal win over Gasquet, Wawrinka was just that little bit better, considering he was playing the man who knocked the stuffing out of Andy Murray \u2013 Kevin Anderson. \n \nWawrinka has not had as smooth a progress as Federer \u2013 going into the quarterfinal, Wawrinka had covered nearly twice as much distance as Federer \u2013 but that performance against Anderson will give him the confidence needed to make this semifinal a contest. \n \n\"For sure the best match of the tournament for me,\" Wawrinka said after beating Anderson6-4, 6-4, 6-0. \"I was really happy the way I play. I was focused on doing what I wanted on the match. \n \n\"I was trying to be really aggressive on the return and make him play a mix or some slice, some aggressive play from the baseline.\" \n \nWhere to Watch Live \n \nThe semifinal between Federer and Wawrinka is scheduled as the second match of the evening\/night session at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.

{"id":"e6610096-0c70-40c9-9d52-f9edccca8d61","content":"WOODBRIDGE, N.J. , Sept. 15, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --\u00a0The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its international counterpart, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) , are expected to release their final respective versions of the Lease Accounting Standards by the end of 2015, with implementation required by 2017-2018. \u00a0The IASB is expected to release soon, and the US Board is expected to follow suit by the end of this year. \u00a0The Standard requires lessees to record all real estate and equipment leases of more than one year on the balance sheet as liabilities, with corresponding assets called \"Right of Use\" (ROU) assets.\u00a0 The impact of this accounting standard change will have a profound impact on a company's capital structure, leasing practices and operational processes. In fact, it has been estimated that the accounting change will add $1.35+ trillion of assets and liabilities to company balance sheets. \n\nThe new standard will require significant work for US corporations and any entity reporting on a GAAP basis.\u00a0 All leases will have to be analyzed to determine their current ROU and liability values, and such calculations will have to go back three years to stay compliant with Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. \u00a0Interestingly, in a recently published survey by IBM, 92% of companies surveyed indicated that they were not prepared to implement the Standard, either in terms of lease information systems, employee training or leasing practices and policies. \n   \n\"This is a fundamental shift in how we account for real estate assets.\u00a0 Although the exact details of the lease accounting standard changes are yet to be seen in their final form, most of the elements have now been defined, and companies already should be collecting the data needed to generate the required entries.\u00a0 With everything that needs to be done, companies that wait until the last minute will certainly regret not acting sooner,\" says Michael Bell , Senior Advisor at Visual Lease. \u00a0See Visual Lease's whitepaper, \" The Lease Accounting Tsunami; Are You Prepared to Weather the Storm? \" \n\nAccording to Michael, some of questions you should be asking now to get prepared for the transition include: \nHow does the new standard affect the current lease portfolio? \u00a0Specifically, what is the total asset value (ROU) and liability value after recalculating the company's lease portfolio? How will these new values affect the company's key financial indicators such as ROA (return on assets), debt to equity ratio, and related taxes? How should future lease\/buy decisions change in light of the new standard? What portion of the lease portfolio will be impacted by the international standards, which differ slightly from the US FASB standard? \u00a0 What data elements and system enhancements are needed to the company's lease management system, lease accounting processes and personnel training to comply with the new standard?\u00a0\u00a0 \n\"In order to ensure that our clients have the most up-to-date analytical capabilities, Visual Lease's FASB functionality will capture all of the needed data elements and perform all the required analyses.\u00a0 In fact, we built this two years ago when FASB issued its first Exposure Draft, but put further development on hold because FASB was not clear on its final direction,\" says Derek Anderson , Managing Director of Visual Lease.\u00a0 \"Now that FASB is close to issuing the Standard, we are completing our development work.\u00a0 But for us, not only must it work properly, it has to be as easy to use as the rest of the system.\u00a0 We know that simplicity and clarity are two of Visual Lease's most important differentiators.\u00a0 The FASB changes can be no different.\u00a0 Visual Lease's FASB functionality will be clean, easy and effective.\"\u00a0 \n\nThe new FASB lease accounting changes in Visual Lease will include: \nIdentification of the financial impact of the changes on the portfolio Automated identification of Type A and Type B leases Portfolio reporting under both FASB and IASB rules Automation of the generation of ROU and liability entries for the general ledger \nAdditionally, Visual Lease will work with its clients to help them identify the impact of the changes as well as strategies for mitigation and accommodation.\u00a0 Marc Betesh , Founder and CEO of Visual Lease, added \"Our 30 years of lease accounting expertise will provide a critical advantage for our clients.\u00a0 We understand how the new Standard should optimally fold into existing processes, as not only were we direct FASB roundtable participants, but we've been working with lease accounting since well before any of the lease management systems were developed.\"\u00a0 \n\nAbout Visual Lease \n\nVisual Lease's mission is to facilitate efficient administration and exact compliance of real estate obligations through world-class software and customer service.

She may not be as strong academically as her elder sister, but she is no slouch either. The dizzying results woke me up from my slumber. No, I am not hibernating, but I have been so busy with work that I have not been focusing on my children's academic needs.\n\nIt's easy to blame my second daughter for not studying hard enough or spending too much time playing video games. But I know I have to take partial responsibility for barely putting any effort to guide her along, especially since I am quite good at maths. In the past, my \"Tiger Mum\" wife - who is also a teacher - stayed home to discipline the children and ensure they completed the endless worksheets and assessment books that she prepared for them.\n\nThanks to the Ministry of Education's flexible work policy that allows teachers who are mothers with young children to take no-pay childcare leave until they turn four, my wife spent almost 10 years at home nursing and nurturing our three girls.\n\nWhen our youngest child turned four this year, that privilege ended and my wife is now back at work. Our hectic workload means that we have had little time left to teach the children.\n\nI decided to run through the test paper with my second daughter to identify her weaknesses. That was when I realised the problem was much worse than I had imagined.\n\nI knew she used to have difficulty rounding off numbers and decimals, and had helped her with that. I discovered she now has trouble with multiplication, adding fractions with different denominators and converting fractions to decimals.\n\nAt this rate, I thought to myself, it will only get worse. How can she stand a chance to complete problem sums when her basics are in the deep end?\n\nI used to be relaxed about her grades, since the PSLE is still some time away. But the discovery of her weak arithmetic fundamentals has sprung me into action.\n\nThe first thing I had to think about: Should I take away her smartphone?\n\nShe can spend hours lying on the sofa with it, reading fan fiction and playing games which require her to groom Pokemon-looking pets into majestic beings, while her grades are plumbing new lows.\n\nI have this part figured out - I will swop her smartphone with a dumb phone, so that she can remain contactable without spending all her time on mobile cyberspace.\n\nThe second thing I'm doing is to go through her schoolwork and figure out the fundamentals she needs to pick up for her level.\n\nI'm still trying to make sense of what she said: Teachers do not go through the textbook, but come up with their own teaching materials instead. Perhaps life was easier when I was in primary school, because understanding everything in the textbook was good enough for me to score As then. From what I remember, maths requires plenty of practice and perhaps that is what is missing.\n\nI hate to say this, but it looks like I will have to search for suitable assessment books to \"drill\" her into solving the various permutations of maths problems that may crop up in the exams.\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, I will have to set aside an hour every day to assign her work and check on her answers. To help me do so better, I'm thinking of investing in a Web camera that lets me monitor my home on my smartphone and comes with two-way audio communications, so that I can bark into the microphone if I see her lounging around instead of completing her assignments.\n\nI can do all this, or I can simply just hire a tuition teacher for her. The latter sounds enticing since I do not have to do anything else except write a cheque every month and monitor my spending.\n\nBut that would be a cop-out, wouldn't it? And one day when I am old, my child will also hire a foreign domestic worker to take care of me, instead of doing it herself.\n\nLike many things in my life, I will choose the harder path. Not because I am a masochist, but simply because it is the right thing to do.\n\nThe tuition teacher might\n\ndo his best for the child, but only the parent will be relentless until the child is able to pass her next maths exam.","title":"Parenting not as simple as 1, 2, 3","media-type":"News","source":"Straits Times","published":"2015-09-13T21:00:00Z"}
